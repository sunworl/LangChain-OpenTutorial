        "`LangChain` provides optional caching layer for LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is useful for two reasons:\n",
        "- When requesting the same completions multiple times, it can **reduce the number of API calls** to the LLM provider and thus save costs.\n",
        "- By **reduing the number of API calls** to the LLM provider, it can **improve the running time of the application.**\n",
        "\n",
        "But sometimes you need to deploy your own LLM service, like on-premise system where you cannot reach cloud services.\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will use `vllm` OpenAI compatible API and utilize two kinds of cache, ```InMemoryCache``` and ```SQLiteCache```.  \n",
        "At end of each section we will compare wall times between before and after caching.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even though this is a tutorial for local LLM service case, we will remind you about how to use cache with OpenAI API service first.\n",
