    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern AI systems, **memory management** is essential for crafting **personalized and context-aware** user experiences. Without the ability to recall prior messages, an AI assistant would quickly become repetitive and less engaging. This updated code demonstrates a robust approach to handling both **short-term** and **long-term** memory in a conversational setting, by integrating:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A central `Configuration` class for managing runtime parameters (such as `user_id` and model name)\n",
    "- An `upsert_memory` function for **storing** or **updating** user data in a memory store\n",
    "- A `call_model` function that **retrieves** context-relevant memories and incorporates them into the system prompt for the model\n",
    "- A `store_memory` function that **persists** newly identified memories and tool calls\n",
    "- A `StateGraph` that orchestrates the entire conversation flow, connecting nodes like `call_model` and `store_memory` to streamline user interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these components, your conversation agent can maintain **deep context** over multiple turns, provide more accurate and engaging responses, and seamlessly update its memory when new information arises. This design illustrates a scalable way to build conversational AI systems that dynamically **remember**, **reason**, and **respond** according to user needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory refers to the capability of an AI system to **store**, **retrieve**, and **use** information. In conversational AI, this typically involves recalling the user’s previous statements, preferences, or relevant context—leading to more **personalized** and **adaptive** interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-term memory lets your application remember previous interactions within a single thread or conversation. A thread organizes multiple interactions in a session, similar to the way email groups messages in a single conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph manages short-term memory as part of the agent's state, persisted via thread-scoped checkpoints. This state can normally include the conversation history along with other stateful data, such as uploaded files, retrieved documents, or generated artifacts. By storing these in the graph's state, the bot can access the full context for a given conversation while maintaining separation between different threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since conversation history is the most common form of representing short-term memory, in the next section, we will cover techniques for managing conversation history when the list of messages becomes long.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term memory extends an AI system's capability to recall information across multiple conversations or sessions. Unlike short-term memory, which focuses on maintaining the context of a single thread, long-term memory stores **persistent information** such as user preferences, key facts, and important events. This enables the system to create a **seamless and personalized user experience** over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term memory is typically used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall User Preferences**: For example, remembering a user prefers movie recommendations in a specific genre.\n",
    "- **Track Progress**: Storing milestones or progress made in ongoing projects or discussions.\n",
    "- **Adapt Over Time**: Learning about the user’s changing interests or requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, long-term memory is managed through **memory upserts** that save critical user information to a persistent data store. This allows the agent to access, update, and retrieve information beyond a single conversational thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Long-term Memory Works in LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangGraph, long-term memory is implemented as part of a **persistent data layer**, decoupled from the conversational state. Key components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Store**: A database or key-value store where long-term memory records are saved.\n",
    "2. **Memory Retrieval**: Mechanisms to fetch relevant memories based on the current conversation context.\n",
    "3. **Memory Updates**: Processes to modify or append new data to existing memory entries when user information evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "By linking long-term memory with `call_model` and `store_memory` functions, the system can ensure that the language model has access to **relevant, long-term context**. This makes interactions more coherent and reduces repetitive queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges with Long-term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: As the number of users and stored records grows, querying and retrieving relevant memories efficiently becomes a challenge.\n",
    "- **Relevance Filtering**: Not all past information is useful for every interaction. Filtering out irrelevant data while retaining critical context is key.\n",
    "- **Data Privacy**: Long-term memory must comply with privacy regulations, ensuring sensitive data is securely handled and stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-term vs Long-term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "|**Type**|**Scope**|**Purpose**|**Example**|\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|**Short-term Memory**|Single conversational thread|Maintains recent interactions to provide immediate context|Last few user prompts in the current conversation|\n",
    "|**Long-term Memory**|Multiple threads & sessions|Stores key information and summarized data to maintain continuity across broader conversations|User preferences, important facts, or conversation history|\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Short-term Memory**: Helps the system focus on the latest messages for immediate context.\n",
    "- **Long-term Memory**: Enables the agent to recall **past sessions** and user-specific details, creating a more **persistent** experience over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use LangGraph's checkpointer?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Session Memory & Error Recovery\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Lets you roll back to a previous checkpoint if an error occurs or if you want to resume from a saved state\n",
    "    - Maintains context across conversations for a more seamless user experience\n",
    "2. Flexible Database Options & Scalability\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Supports in-memory, SQLite, Postgres, and more, allowing easy scaling as your user base grows\n",
    "    - Choose the storage method that best fits your project’s needs\n",
    "3. Human-in-the-Loop & Time Travel\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Pause workflows for human review, then resume where you left off\n",
    "    - Go back to earlier states (“time travel”) to debug or create alternative paths\n",
    "4. Ecosystem & Customization\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `LangGraph` v0.2 offers separate checkpointer libraries (e.g., `MemorySaver`, `SqliteSaver`, `PostgresSaver`)\n",
    "    - Easily build or adapt custom solutions for specific databases or workflows\n",
