    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to build an Onboarding Helper using `LangChain`, designed to centralize and leverage Notion-based documentation for new employees. By integrating structured data from Notion pages, databases, and wikis into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, this solution enables seamless access to company protocols, role-specific guides, and FAQs. New hires can query this unified knowledge base in natural language, helping them quickly adapt to their roles without sifting through scattered documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional onboarding often involves digging through wikis, PDFs, and email threads to find relevant information. This approach is time-consuming and inefficient, especially as companies scale. With a Notion-powered RAG system, employees can simply ask questions in natural language and get precise, contextual answers in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond efficiency, this approach also reduces friction in communication. New employees often hesitate to repeatedly ask their managers or senior colleagues the same questions, worrying that they might be bothering them. With a chatbot, however, this concern disappears—they can ask the same question multiple times, verify small details, and gradually build confidence in their tasks, leading to a faster adaptation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this is not just about onboarding—it’s about knowledge retention and accessibility. In any workplace, documenting work is essential, whether it’s through small personal notes or structured data within a digital workspace. If a team already uses Notion as their primary documentation tool, integrating this RAG system means that records naturally become part of the chatbot’s knowledge base. As team members work and document processes, the chatbot continuously updates its resource pool, making the information available for future queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that once the system is in place, it doesn’t just serve new employees—it benefits the entire team. What starts as an onboarding assistant evolves into a company-wide knowledge hub, reducing redundant questions, ensuring information consistency, and making expertise accessible to everyone. Instead of spending time searching or asking around, employees can simply ask the chatbot, allowing them to focus on doing their work more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying This to Other Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if your organization doesn’t use Notion, the concepts covered here can be easily adapted to other structured knowledge bases such as Confluence, Google Drive, SharePoint, or internal databases. If your company already maintains a central knowledge repository, you can apply the same techniques to build a similar retrieval-based AI assistant tailored to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will provide both the foundational understanding and practical implementation steps necessary to deploy an AI-powered onboarding assistant, improving information accessibility and reducing the time it takes for new employees to become productive. 🚀\n",

    "## Notion Database Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Notion as our central hub for team wikis, documentation, and task management, making it an essential tool for organizing and sharing knowledge. Notion provides a highly flexible digital workspace that combines note-taking, structured databases, and real-time collaboration tools, allowing teams to centralize their knowledge in a way that is both intuitive and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional documentation tools, Notion allows for seamless integration of structured and unstructured data, meaning that everything from meeting notes and company policies to project roadmaps and task assignments can coexist within a single, well-organized system. With its database-driven approach, information can be filtered, sorted, and interconnected, making retrieval faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Notion as the foundation for our RAG system, we can transform passive documentation into an active knowledge base. This means that instead of manually searching through scattered files and folders, employees can interact with a chatbot that intelligently retrieves relevant information based on natural language queries. The result is a dynamic, constantly evolving repository of company knowledge, improving both onboarding experiences and day-to-day productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts of Notion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pages: Individual documents (like this guide) for text, images, or embedded content.\n",
    "- Databases: Structured tables that organize information (e.g., tasks, project trackers, SOPs) with filter/sort capabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. Find Database ID\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Notion Database:\n",
    "   Go to the database you or your team want to use → Click \"Share\" → \"Copy link\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extract the ID:  \n",
    "   The URL looks like:  \n",
    "   https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/{DATABASE_ID}?v=...  \n",

    "In this section, we will implement RAG using only `LangChain`. Since the data prepared for this tutorial is not very long, we have skipped the chunking process during the data preprocessing stage of RAG. To enhance RAG performance, we have enabled similarity search based on the titles of the documents.\n",
    "\n",

These components are essential for building powerful AI-driven retrieval systems, so taking the time to understand them will be highly beneficial.\n",

    "If you find certain steps difficult to follow, consider revisiting the basics of how vector stores index and retrieve information or how similarity search helps match queries with relevant documents.

    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we explored various ways to enhance a basic RAG system using `LangChain` and `LangGraph`. We started with a simple similarity search-based RAG implementation, then introduced an agent to filter retrieved documents, ensuring they contribute meaningfully to the final response. Finally, we refined the user query handling by segmenting and processing sub-questions in parallel, creating a more structured and intelligent response system.\n",
    "\n",
    "One point I want to highlight—though it may seem less critical functionally—is the tight integration between `LangChain` and `LangGraph`. Rather than thinking of them as separate choices, it's more effective to use them flexibly depending on the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LangGraph` builds on LangChain's Runnable architecture, meaning you don’t have to choose one over the other. Instead, you can seamlessly invoke `LangGraph` workflows within a standard `LangChain` chain, or even integrate LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) to construct more modular and expressive logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the key takeaway is that `LangChain` and `LangGraph` complement each other—leveraging both allows for greater adaptability, whether you're optimizing retrieval, structuring workflows, or improving response generation. The best approach isn't about choosing one, but about knowing when and how to use each effectively.\n"
