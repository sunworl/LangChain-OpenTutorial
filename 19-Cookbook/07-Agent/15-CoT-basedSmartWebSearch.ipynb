    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates a chain-of-thought (CoT) based smart web search approach designed to build a plan-and-execute style QA chatbot. The system breaks down complex user queries into a sequence of actionable steps such as **search**, **extraction**, **reasoning**, and **response generation**. It leverages language models to perform each task, ensuring that every phase of the process is handled efficiently and accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to set up your environment, install the necessary packages, and define key data models using `Pydantic`. These models enforce a structured workflow by representing each task step (e.g., **search**, **think**, and **respond**) and by specifying how references and final outputs should be formatted in markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is composed of multiple nodes, each responsible for a specific phase of the processing pipeline. You will see how the system generates a plan from a user query, retrieves raw information from the web, extracts and summarizes the relevant data, optionally refines the results through additional reasoning, and finally compiles a comprehensive answer. The nodes are dynamically connected through a routing function that adapts to the current state of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect of this tutorial is the integration of asynchronous execution, which allows the entire workflow to run in real time. This not only improves performance but also provides immediate feedback during long-running tasks, making it easier to monitor and debug the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chain-of-Thought Query Expansion**: Breaks down complex queries into manageable steps.\n",
    "- **Modular Workflow**: Separates the process into distinct nodes for planning, searching, extracting, reasoning, and responding.\n",
    "- **Asynchronous Execution**: Enables real-time streaming and monitoring of the workflow.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Task Routing**: Adapts the processing sequence based on the current state, ensuring efficient task handling.\n",
    "- **Robust Data Modeling**: Uses `Pydantic` to enforce data consistency and type safety throughout the system.\n",

AI technologies enabled better demand forecasting, inventory management, and logistics optimization, which were crucial as supply chains faced unprecedented challenges. For instance, AI-driven analytics allowed companies to predict demand surges and adjust their supply strategies accordingly, minimizing delays and shortages[1]. Moreover, AI facilitated real-time tracking and visibility across the supply chain, helping businesses to quickly adapt to changing conditions and maintain operational continuity[2].\\n\\n## Current Trends in AI-Driven Supply Chains\\n\\nCurrently, AI in supply chains is focused on increasing automation, enhancing decision-making, and improving sustainability. Automation through AI-driven robotics and machine learning algorithms is streamlining operations by reducing human error and increasing speed and accuracy. Decision-making is being enhanced through advanced data analytics, which provide insights that help businesses respond swiftly to market changes. Additionally, AI is playing a pivotal role in driving sustainability by optimizing resource use and reducing waste[3].\\n\\n## Future Projections for AI-Driven Supply Chains\\n\\nLooking ahead, AI is expected to transform supply chains over the next decade by further integrating advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain for greater transparency and efficiency. AI-driven supply chains will likely become more autonomous, with increased use of predictive analytics and machine learning to anticipate disruptions and optimize operations proactively. Furthermore, as AI technologies continue to evolve, they are expected to contribute to more sustainable practices, helping companies meet environmental goals and comply with regulations[4].\\n\\n[1]: [How AI Helped Supply Chains During COVID-19](https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-covid)\\n[2]: [The Role of AI in Supply Chain Management](https://www.example.com/role-of-ai-supply-chain)\\n[3]: [Current Trends in AI-Driven Supply Chains](https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-trends)\\n[4]: [Future of AI in Supply Chains](https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-future)\",\"references\":[{\"citation_id\":1,\"title\":\"How AI Helped Supply Chains During COVID-19\",\"url\":\"https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-covid\"},{\"citation_id\":2,\"title\":\"The Role of AI in Supply Chain Management\",\"url\":\"https://www.example.com/role-of-ai-supply-chain\"},{\"citation_id\":3,\"title\":\"Current Trends in AI-Driven Supply Chains\",\"url\":\"https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-trends\"},{\"citation_id\":4,\"title\":\"Future of AI in Supply Chains\",\"url\":\"https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-future\"}]}"

       " 'answer': FinalResponse(markdown='## Impact of AI on Supply Chain Management During COVID-19\\n\\nThe implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in supply chain management during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly improved global trade efficiency by addressing disruptions and enhancing resilience. AI technologies enabled better demand forecasting, inventory management, and logistics optimization, which were crucial as supply chains faced unprecedented challenges. For instance, AI-driven analytics allowed companies to predict demand surges and adjust their supply strategies accordingly, minimizing delays and shortages[1]. Moreover, AI facilitated real-time tracking and visibility across the supply chain, helping businesses to quickly adapt to changing conditions and maintain operational continuity[2].\\n\\n## Current Trends in AI-Driven Supply Chains\\n\\nCurrently, AI in supply chains is focused on increasing automation, enhancing decision-making, and improving sustainability. Automation through AI-driven robotics and machine learning algorithms is streamlining operations by reducing human error and increasing speed and accuracy. Decision-making is being enhanced through advanced data analytics, which provide insights that help businesses respond swiftly to market changes. Additionally, AI is playing a pivotal role in driving sustainability by optimizing resource use and reducing waste[3].\\n\\n## Future Projections for AI-Driven Supply Chains\\n\\nLooking ahead, AI is expected to transform supply chains over the next decade by further integrating advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain for greater transparency and efficiency. AI-driven supply chains will likely become more autonomous, with increased use of predictive analytics and machine learning to anticipate disruptions and optimize operations proactively. Furthermore, as AI technologies continue to evolve, they are expected to contribute to more sustainable practices, helping companies meet environmental goals and comply with regulations[4].\\n\\n[1]: [How AI Helped Supply Chains During COVID-19](https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-covid)\\n[2]: [The Role of AI in Supply Chain Management](https://www.example.com/role-of-ai-supply-chain)\\n[3]: [Current Trends in AI-Driven Supply Chains](https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-trends)\\n[4]: [Future of AI in Supply Chains](https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-future)', references=[Reference(citation_id=1, title='How AI Helped Supply Chains During COVID-19', url='https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-covid'), Reference(citation_id=2, title='The Role of AI in Supply Chain Management', url='https://www.example.com/role-of-ai-supply-chain'), Reference(citation_id=3, title='Current Trends in AI-Driven Supply Chains', url='https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-trends'), Reference(citation_id=4, title='Future of AI in Supply Chains', url='https://www.example.com/ai-supply-chain-future')])}"
