    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates a chain-of-thought (**CoT**) based smart web search approach designed to build a **plan-and-execute** style QA chatbot. The system breaks down complex user queries into a sequence of actionable steps such as **search**, **extraction**, **reasoning**, and **response generation**. It leverages large language models to perform each task, ensuring that every phase of the process is handled efficiently and accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to set up your environment, install the necessary packages, and define key data models using **`Pydantic`**. These models enforce a structured workflow by representing each task step (e.g., **search**, **think**, and **respond**) and by specifying how references and final outputs should be formatted in Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is composed of multiple nodes, each responsible for a specific phase of the processing pipeline. You will see how the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generates a plan from a user query\n",
    "2. Retrieves raw information from the web\n",
    "3. Extracts and summarizes the relevant data\n",
    "4. Optionally refines the results through additional reasoning\n",
    "5. Compiles a comprehensive final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The nodes are dynamically connected through a routing function that adapts to the current state of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect of this tutorial is the integration of **asynchronous execution**, which allows the entire workflow to run in real time. This not only improves performance but also provides immediate feedback during long-running tasks, making it easier to monitor and debug the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chain-of-Thought Query Expansion**: Breaks down complex queries into manageable steps.  \n",
    "- **Modular Workflow**: Separates the process into distinct nodes (planning, searching, extracting, reasoning, responding).  \n",
    "- **Asynchronous Execution**: Enables real-time monitoring and concurrency for improved performance.  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Task Routing**: Adapts the processing sequence based on the current state, ensuring each node is executed as needed.  \n",
    "- **Robust Data Modeling**: Uses `Pydantic` to ensure consistent data structures and type safety.\n",
