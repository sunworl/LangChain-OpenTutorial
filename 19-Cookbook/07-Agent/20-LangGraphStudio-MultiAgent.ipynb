    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a **Multi-agent workflow** by integrating `LangChain` with `LangGraph Studio`, allowing you to orchestrate multiple specialized agents for gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information. In this tutorial, we focus on researching a specific person, their professional background, and the company they work for, as well as generating relevant follow-up questions or interview prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "By visualizing this agent workflow in `LangGraph Studio`, you can easily debug, modify, and extend the pipeline. Each agent’s output can be inspected step by step, making it straightforward to add new components or adjust the process flow.\n",

    "\n",
    "`LangGraph Studio` offers a new way to develop LLM applications by providing a specialized agent IDE that enables visualization, interaction, and debugging of complex agentic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "With visual graphs and the ability to edit state, you can better understand agent workflows and iterate faster. `LangGraph Studio` integrates with LangSmith so you can collaborate with teammates to debug failure modes.\n",

    "To use LangGraph Studio, make sure you have a [project with a LangGraph app](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/setup/) set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The desktop application only supports `macOS`. Other users can run a local LangGraph server and use the `web studio`. \n",

    "- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)\n",
    "- [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Please make sure you have `Docker Desktop` or `Orbstack` installed and running before continuing.\n",
