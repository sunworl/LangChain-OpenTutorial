    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides practical examples for building and evaluating dynamic AI agent prompts using LangChain. The notebook is organized around two main templates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AI_CAREER_PLANNER_AGENT_PROMPT**  \n",
    "   This section demonstrates how to construct a robust prompt template that generates personalized study plans for users aspiring to become AI engineers. It covers:\n",
    "   - **Tool Definitions**: Functions such as `resource_recommender` and `timeline_generator` are implemented to tailor learning resources and study timelines according to the user's skill gaps.\n",
    "   - **Prompt Template**: The prompt template clearly defines the agent's role and behavioral guidelines, establishes working memory management, and integrates tools for generating actionable, structured study plans.\n",
    "   - **Memory Initialization and Response Formatting**: It ensures that conversation history is maintained and outputs are formatted in a clear Markdown structure.\n",
    "   - **Runnable Chain**: All components are integrated into a chain that processes user input, invokes the tools, and produces a final study plan, demonstrating flexibility and user-specific customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **PROMPT_QUALITY_EVALUATION_TEMPLATE**  \n",
    "   This section illustrates a two-part process:\n",
    "   - **Prompt Generation**: A generation template is employed to create prompts based on a user’s goal (e.g., developing a study plan for an AI engineering career).\n",
    "   - **Prompt Evaluation**: An evaluation template is defined for a Prompt Quality Reviewer agent that verifies the generated prompt against defined criteria such as identity clarity, memory management, tool integration, plan completeness, and overall quality.  \n",
    "     *Note*: Every literal `{` and `}` inside the JSON block is replaced with `{{` and `}}` to avoid unintended substitutions during Python’s formatting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these templates showcase a modular and scalable approach to designing, generating, and evaluating dynamic prompts for AI agents. By integrating tool functions, context-aware memory management, and rigorous evaluation criteria, the notebook provides concrete examples of how to achieve intelligent task processing and high-quality agent output in real-world scenarios.\n",

    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates the implementation of the **AI_CAREER_PLANNER_AGENT_PROMPT**, which is designed to generate personalized study plans for users aiming to become AI engineers. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Tool Definitions**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Two tools are defined to assist in creating the study plan:\n",
    "  - **`resource_recommender`**: Recommends learning resources based on the user's current skills and target skills.\n",
    "    - Input: User's current skills and desired target skills.\n",
    "    - Output: A list of recommended resources, including course names, descriptions, and URLs.\n",
    "  - **`timeline_generator`**: Generates a milestone-based study timeline.\n",
    "    - Input: User's current skills and available study time (in weeks).\n",
    "    - Output: A structured timeline with weekly goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - The tools ensure that the recommendations and timelines are tailored to the user's skill gaps.\n",
    "  - Default target skills include Python, Linear Algebra, and Deep Learning, which are essential for AI engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Prompt Template**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The `ChatPromptTemplate` defines the behavior and role of the AI agent. It provides clear instructions for generating a structured study plan.\n",
    "- **Key Elements**:\n",
    "  - **Agent Identity**: Specifies that the agent is an \"AI Career Planning Specialist\" with expertise in AI research and education.\n",
    "  - **Behavioral Guidelines**:\n",
    "    - Analyze skill gaps.\n",
    "    - Recommend accessible learning resources.\n",
    "    - Create realistic timelines with milestones.\n",
    "  - **Working Memory Management**:\n",
    "    - Tracks the current task context, progress, and pending actions.\n",
    "    - Maintains awareness of conversation history and user input.\n",
    "  - **Tool Integration**:\n",
    "    - Utilizes `resource_recommender` for learning resources.\n",
    "    - Uses `timeline_generator` for creating timelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Requirements**:\n",
    "  - The response must be in Markdown format with sections for skill gap analysis, recommended resources, a timeline, and progress tracking checkpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Memory Initialization**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Initializes memory using `ConversationKGMemory` to maintain conversation history and context across interactions.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**:\n",
    "  - If memory initialization fails, it falls back to a default empty memory state to ensure robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Response Formatting**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Formats the output from the LLM or tool chain into a structured Markdown response for better readability.\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Combines recommendations and timeline into a single cohesive response.\n",
    "  - Ensures that each section (resources, timeline) is clearly presented with actionable details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Runnable Chain**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Combines all components into a runnable chain that processes user input and generates a personalized study plan.\n",
    "- **Steps in the Chain**:\n",
    "  1. Passes user input directly using `RunnablePassthrough`.\n",
    "  2. Loads conversation history using `RunnableLambda(load_memory)`.\n",
    "  3. Executes tools (`resource_recommender`, `timeline_generator`) to generate recommendations and timelines.\n",
    "  4. Processes inputs through the prompt template (`prompt`) to guide the LLM's behavior.\n",
    "  5. Formats the final output using `RunnableLambda(format_response)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Example Usage**\n",
    "- Demonstrates how to use the runnable chain to generate a study plan for a user aiming to become an AI engineer.\n",
    "- Example Input:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  {\n",
    "      \"input\": \"I want to become an AI engineer. I know {current_skills}.\",\n",
    "      \"current_skills\": [\"Basic Python\"],\n",
    "      \"target_skills\": [\"Python\", \"Linear Algebra\", \"Deep Learning\"],\n",
    "      \"weeks_available\": 12,\n",

    "## PROMPT_QUALITY_EVALUATION_TEMPLATE\n",
    "\n",
    "This template is designed to evaluate the quality of generated prompts produced for AI agent tasks. It follows a two-part structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Generation:** Creates a high-quality prompt based on a user-defined goal.\n",
    "2. **Prompt Evaluation:** Uses an evaluation template to review the generated prompt against key criteria and returns structured feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key note for this template is that every literal `{` and `}` inside the JSON block has been replaced with `{{` and `}}` to ensure that Python’s `.format()` method does not mistakenly treat them as placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Prompt Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective:**  \n",
    "  A prompt is generated for the purpose of creating a study plan for becoming an AI engineer. This generated prompt is meant to guide an AI agent in creating a comprehensive career preparation plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implementation Details:**\n",
    "  - A **generation template** is created using `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages()`.  \n",
    "  - The system message instructs the agent (acting as a Prompt Generator) on the required components of the prompt:\n",
    "    - Agent Identity and Role\n",
    "    - Behavioral Guidelines and Success Criteria\n",
    "    - Task Description and Input Parameters\n",
    "    - Instructions for memory management and tool integration\n",
    "  - A human message accepts the `{user_goal}` as input.\n",
    "  - The `user_goal_text` variable contains an example goal where the user specifies they want to develop a study plan targeting improvements in Python programming, data analysis, and fundamental machine learning concepts.\n",
    "  - The prompt is then generated by calling `generation_template.format_messages(user_goal=user_goal_text)` and concatenated into a single string (`generated_prompt_str`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Prompt Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective:**  \n",
    "  The evaluation template reviews the generated prompt to ensure that it adheres to best practices for prompt quality. It checks if various aspects of the prompt are well defined and actionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implementation Details:**\n",
    "  - An **evaluation template** is defined using `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages()` with a system message that:\n",
    "    - Sets the task by defining the role of a **Prompt Quality Reviewer**.\n",
    "    - Provides the **Content to Review** using a `{generated_prompt}` placeholder.\n",
    "    - Outlines **Verification Steps** that cover:\n",
    "      1. **Identity and Role Clarity:** Checks if the agent’s role, purpose, and behavioral guidelines are clear.\n",
    "      2. **Memory Management:** Assesses the structure for managing context.\n",
    "      3. **Tool Integration:** Reviews the mention and use of necessary tools.\n",
    "      4. **Plan Completeness:** Ensures all aspects required for the task are present, including clear input parameters.\n",
    "      5. **Quality Standards:** Evaluates clarity, conciseness, and overall effectiveness.\n",
    "    - Specifies a **Return Format** in JSON. Notice the use of double curly braces (`{{` and `}}`) in the JSON block. This prevents Python’s string formatter from interpreting them as variable placeholders. It outlines expected keys like `\"score\"`, `\"feedback\"` (with sub-fields like `identity_clarity`, `memory_management`, etc.), and an array of `\"improvement_suggestions\"`.\n",
    "    - Provides an **Example Response** within the template to illustrate how the evaluation should be formatted.\n",
    "  - A human message passes the `{generated_prompt}` into the evaluation template.\n",
    "  - The code then calls `evaluation_template.format_messages(generated_prompt=generated_prompt_str)` to properly inject the generated prompt into the evaluation template.\n",
    "  - Finally, the evaluation prompt is sent to the LLM (`ChatOpenAI`) that returns a structured evaluation response based on the defined criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works Together\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generation:**  \n",
    "   The user goal is processed to create a detailed prompt that instructs an AI agent on how to build a personalized study plan. The strategy is to ensure that all necessary details (like identity, behavioral guidelines, and instructions for memory and tool integration) are clearly defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation:**  \n",
    "   Once generated, the prompt is reviewed by another sub-agent (acting as a Prompt Quality Reviewer). The evaluation checks for clarity, completeness, and technical feasibility based on the provided criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **JSON Formatting:**  \n",
    "   To avoid conflict with Python’s string formatting, all literal curly braces in the JSON block are doubled. This ensures that the evaluation response is formatted as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical example demonstrates a modular approach where one agent generates a prompt while another evaluates its quality. Both parts integrate with LangChain's templating system, allowing for the creation of dynamic, high-quality prompts that can adapt based on user input."
