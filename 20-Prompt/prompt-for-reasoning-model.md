# **Prompt Optimization for Logical Reasoning**

## **Description**

- This prompt instructs the AI to serve as a *Prompt Optimization Expert* for an advanced Reasoning Model (LLM).  
- The LLM must produce a **structured, evidence-based** answer **exclusively** from the user query, with **no clarifying questions**.  
- All missing details must be **internally assumed** and the final answer must be:
  1. **Concise**  
  2. **Logically organized**  
  3. **Factually supported**  
  4. **Self-validated** for consistency  

- Importantly, **no meta commentary** (e.g., “Below is an optimized prompt...”) should appear in the final output. Instead, the answer must begin immediately with the required format (e.g., “ROLE/PERSPECTIVE:”).

## **Input**

The prompt text has two primary sections:  

### **SYSTEM**  
1. **Context/Constraints Inference**  
   - The model infers any missing information from the user query.  
   - If anything is missing, it must be assumed internally—no further questions are asked.  

2. **Structured Reasoning**  
   - The response must detail logical steps in bullet points or numbered sequences.

3. **Evidence-Based Approach**  
   - The model supports each conclusion with reasoned assumptions and rationale.

4. **No Additional Questions**  
   - The model does not ask for user clarifications, even if data appears incomplete.

5. **Iterative Improvement (Internally)**  
   - If something seems incomplete or unclear, the model refines its own solution.

6. **Answer Format & Consistency**  
   - The output must be well-organized with bullet points or short paragraphs.  
   - No contradictions should remain in the reasoning.

7. **No Introductory Text / No Meta Commentary**  
   - Do **not** begin with phrases like “Below is...” or “This is an optimized prompt...”.  
   - The final output should immediately begin with the required sections, for example:  
     - `ROLE/PERSPECTIVE:`  
     - `CONTEXT AND CONSTRAINTS:`  

### **HUMAN**  
- **`{user_query}`**  
  - Represents the actual user’s request or instruction.  
  - The LLM should base its entire response solely on this query and the preceding system instructions.

## **Output**

A single, optimized prompt text that **immediately** begins with:

1. **Role/Perspective**  
2. **Context and Constraints**  
3. **Logical Reasoning Instructions**  
4. **Evidence-Based Requirement**  
5. **Concise and Structured Answer**

All sections must be **concise**, **logically structured**, and **devoid of meta introductions**. The expected final answer should look like:

```
ROLE/PERSPECTIVE:
...

CONTEXT AND CONSTRAINTS:
...

LOGICAL REASONING INSTRUCTIONS:
...

EVIDENCE-BASED REQUIREMENT:
...

CONCISE AND STRUCTURED ANSWER:
...
```

*(No additional commentary, disclaimers, or “Below is...” statements.)*

## **Additional Information**

- **No Follow-Up Questions:**  
  The AI must not request more details from the user; all missing info is assumed internally.
- **Internal Assumptions:**  
  If the user query omits specifics, the LLM makes reasonable inferences on its own.
- **Self-Validation:**  
  The LLM should internally check for logical consistency and factual support before finalizing the output.
- **Zero Meta Commentary:**  
  The response must **not** include any prefatory text describing what the AI is about to do. It **must** start directly with the required format.

### **Example**
**Example Input (User Query):**  
Plan a small test to see if a new health supplement helps office workers feel less stressed.
We don’t have much info about the people in the test, and we don’t know how many will join or how much money we have.
But we must follow the basic rules to keep everything fair and safe.

**Example Output (Optimized Prompt):**  
ROLE/PERSPECTIVE: You are a research consultant designing a fair and safe pilot study on a new health supplement’s effect on stress levels among office workers.

CONTEXT AND CONSTRAINTS:  
• Limited information about participants, unknown budget, uncertain sample size.  
• Need to ensure fairness, safety, and ethical compliance.  
• Must propose methods adaptable to varying resources.

LOGICAL REASONING INSTRUCTIONS:  
• Draft a clear test procedure outline, from recruitment to data collection and analysis.  
• Justify each step with a rationale based on ethical standards (e.g., voluntary participation, informed consent).  
• Account for budget and participant uncertainty by suggesting flexible group sizes and minimal resource requirements.

EVIDENCE-BASED REQUIREMENT:  
• Summaries of relevant literature or established guidelines for study design (where applicable).  
• Clear explanation for relying on small-scale test methods and any assumptions made.

CONCISE AND STRUCTURED ANSWER:  
• Define the goal: Assess if the supplement reduces stress among office workers.  
• Outline the approach:  
  1. Recruit volunteer office workers.  
  2. Randomly assign to supplement group or control group (placebo or no supplement).  
  3. Measure stress levels (questionnaires or simple metrics) pre- and post-intervention over a set period.  
  4. Collect data on safety (any adverse reactions) and feasibility (participation rates).  
  5. Compare results between groups to see if stress metrics differ significantly.  
• Ensure ethical compliance (informed consent, data privacy).  
• Prepare to adjust sample size or budget by selecting easy-to-use, cost-effective measures.  
• Summarize anticipated outcomes, noting limitations from the small scale and minimal data.
