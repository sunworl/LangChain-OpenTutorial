# Prompt for Agent

## Description
- Unlike conventional prompts that focus on generating a single response, Agentic prompts include the use of tools and decision-making steps.
- Agentic prompts can be described as a prompt structure designed to achieve purposes such as **intelligent task processing** (which autonomously breaks down complex goals into sub-steps and selects and utilizes the necessary tools for each step), **adaptive learning systems** (which evaluate intermediate results and reflect and remember them), and **collaboration** (which coordinates and mediates multiple agents).

**Intelligent Task Processing**
- Autonomously breaking down complex goals into sub-steps
- Selecting and utilizing optimized tools for each step
- Establishing and adjusting execution plans for each stage

**Adaptive Learning Systems**
- Continuous evaluation of intermediate results
- Memory storage of performance history and feedback
- Performance optimization through accumulated experience

**Collaboration**
- Coordination of tasks among multiple agents
- Efficient utilization of specialized agents
- Mediation for the derivation of integrated results

These characteristics combine organically to enable the performance of more complex and intelligent tasks, which is the essence of Agentic prompts.

Detailed prompts regarding evaluation, collaboration, and reasoning are covered in other documents; therefore, this document focuses on the definition and authority of agents, state and memory management, and tool integration and result processing.

- Current Conversation Flow: "You are discussing renewable energy's role in climate change."

Decision Queue:
- Unresolved Questions: "Should I include regional data?"
- Required Validations: "Verify the credibility of sources."
- Next Steps: "Compile data into a summary table."
```

### Context Management
Context management maintains long-term conversation flow and task history, enabling agents to respond appropriately based on previous interactions and task outcomes.

```yaml
Maintain contextual awareness through:

Conversation Threading:
- Topic Hierarchy: 
  - Main Topic: "Climate Change"
  - Subtopics: ["Renewable Energy", "Carbon Emissions"]
- Reference Points: 
  - "In the last summary, you mentioned solar energy's impact."

- User Preferences:
  - "Prefers visual data representations like charts."
  - "Requests detailed citations for all sources."
- Important Constraints:
  - "Avoid outdated studies published before 2015."

Memory Refresh Triggers:
- Key Milestones:
  - Completion of article reviews.
  - Finalizing the summary draft.
- Critical Updates:
  - New user input requesting additional focus areas.
  - Discovery of new, relevant research data.
- Context Revalidation:
  - After a significant topic switch.
  - At the start of a new task session.
```

### Summary

This memory management system ensures:

1. **Task Continuity**: Track current status and progress to maintain uninterrupted workflow
2. **Contextual Adaptability**: Provide appropriate responses based on conversation flow and task history
3. **Information Utilization**: Generate consistent and reliable results through effective reference to accumulated information

## Tool Integration Framework

Tool integration is a critical component that enhances the efficiency and accuracy of agent operations. This section provides specific prompt guidelines for tool selection, execution, and result processing.

### Tool Selection and Execution
```yaml
Follow these guidelines for tool utilization:

Analysis Phase:
- Identify task requirements:
  - Example: "Determine if text analysis or numerical computation is required."
- Evaluate available tools:
  - Example: "Choose between 'TextAnalyzer' or 'DataProcessor' based on input type."
- Consider resource constraints:
  - Example: "Ensure tool execution fits within allocated memory and time limits."

Selection Criteria:
- Tool capability match:
  - Example: "Select tools that support JSON input for structured data."
- Performance requirements:
  - Example: "Prioritize tools with faster processing times for large datasets."
- Resource efficiency:
  - Example: "Avoid high-memory tools for lightweight tasks."

Execution Protocol:
- Parameter validation:
  - Example: "Verify input format matches tool specifications (e.g., CSV for data analysis)."
- Error handling:
  - Example: "Retry failed operations up to 3 times or escalate if unresolved."
- Progress monitoring:
  - Example: "Log execution status every 10% of task completion."
```

### Result Processing
```yaml
Handle tool outputs according to these steps:

Validation Framework:
- Output verification:
  - Example: "Check if output contains expected fields (e.g., 'summary', 'keywords')."
- Quality assessment:
  - Example: "Ensure numerical results have a precision of at least two decimal places."
- Consistency check:
  - Example: "Compare output format with predefined schema."

Integration Process:
- Result synthesis:
  - Example: "Combine outputs from multiple tools into a unified report."
- Context updating:
  - Example: "Incorporate new findings into the current task context."
- Memory management:
  - Example: "Store validated results in long-term memory for future reference."

Response Generation:
- Format selection:
  - Example: "Convert raw outputs into user-friendly formats like tables or charts."
- Clarity optimization:
  - Example: "Simplify complex data into concise summaries for better readability."
- Delivery preparation:
  - Example: "Prepare the final response in Markdown format for user presentation."
```
