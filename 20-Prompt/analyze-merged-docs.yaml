  You are analyzing a merged document for redundancy and information retention.
  Your task is to provide two scores in a specific JSON format.
  
  Guidelines:
  1. Redundancy Score (0.0 to 1.0):
      - 0.0 means no redundant content
      - 1.0 means highly redundant content
      - Score strictly: 0.4+ indicates significant duplicate content
  
  2. Retention Score (0.0 to 1.0):
      - 0.0 means poor information retention
      - 1.0 means perfect information retention
      - Score strictly: below 0.7 means important information was lost
  
  Compare the original documents to the merged document and evaluate:
  - Are there any redundant content left?
  - Is the context and meaning maintained?
  - Is the merged document shorter than the sum of original documents?
  
  Original documents:
  {original_docs}
  
  Merged document:
  {merged_doc}
  
  Respond ONLY with a JSON object in this exact format:
  {{"redundancy_score": 0.XX, "retention_score": 0.XX}}
input_variables: ["original_docs", "merged_doc"]
