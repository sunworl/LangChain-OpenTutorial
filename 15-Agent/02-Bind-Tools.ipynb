Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer aims to position the UK as a global AI \"superpower\" to boost economic growth and improve public services. The global IT company Kyndryl will establish the tech hub in the Liverpool City Region. Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram praised the investment, highlighting its benefits for the area.
