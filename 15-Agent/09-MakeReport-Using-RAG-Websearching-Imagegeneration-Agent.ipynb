        "1. **Web Searching Agent:**  \n",
        "   - Performs web searches (via a custom tool) to gather additional real-time information.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Agent:**  \n",
        "   - Uses a local PDF (e.g., Tesla-related) loaded and chunked into a VectorStore.  \n",
        "   - Provides relevant context from the PDF using retrieval tools.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Image Generation Agent:**  \n",
        "   - Utilizes the **DALL·E** tool to generate images based on text prompts.  \n",
        "\n",
        "These agents collect data from a PDF, supplement it with web search results, and enrich the final report with generated images, all while demonstrating **streaming outputs** in real time.\n",
