## Overview

Research is often a labor-intensive task delegated to analysts, but AI holds tremendous potential to revolutionize this process. This tutorial explores **how to construct a customized AI-powered research and report generation workflow** using `LangGraph`, incorporating key concepts from Stanford's STORM framework.

### Why This Approach?
The STORM methodology has demonstrated significant improvements in research quality through two key innovations:
- Outline creation through querying similar topics enhances coverage.
- Multi-perspective conversation simulation increases reference usage and information density.

The translation is accurate but can be enhanced for better clarity and technical precision. Here's the reviewed version:

### Key Components

**Core Themes**
- Memory: State management and persistence across interactions.
- Human-in-the-loop: Interactive feedback and validation mechanisms.
- Controllability: Fine-grained control over agent workflows.

**Research Framework**
- Research Automation Objective: Building customized research processes tailored to user requirements.
- Source Management: Strategic selection and integration of research input sources.
- Planning Framework: Topic definition and AI analyst team assembly.

### Process Implementation

**Execution Flow**
- LLM Integration: Conducting comprehensive expert AI interviews.
- Parallel Processing: Simultaneous information gathering and interview execution.
- Output Synthesis: Integration of research findings into comprehensive reports.

**Technical Implementation**
- Environment Setup: Configuration of runtime environment and API authentication.
- Analyst Development: Human-supervised analyst creation and validation process.
- Interview Management: Systematic question generation and response collection.
- Parallel Processing: Implementation of Map-Reduce for interview parallelization.
- Report Generation: Structured composition of introductory and concluding sections.


AI has significant potential to support these research processes. However, research requires customization. Raw LLM outputs are often not suitable for real decision-making workflows.

A customized AI-based [research and report generation](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/05/predictions-for-the-future-of-rag/#reports-over-rag) workflow is a promising solution to address this issue.

for visualizing graph structure

### `random_uuid` , `invoke_graph`
- `random_uuid` : for generating a random UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) and returns it as a string.
- `invoke_graph` : for streaming and displays the results of executing a CompiledStateGraph instance in a visually appealing format. 

### `TabilySearch`

This code defines a tool for performing search queries using the Tavily Search API. It includes input validation, formatting of search results, and the ability to customize search parameters.
**Methods** :
- `__init__` : Initializes the TavilySearch instance, setting up the API client and input parameters.
- `_run` : Implements the base tool's run method, calling the search method and returning results.
- `search` : Performs the actual search using the Tavily API, taking various optional parameters to customize the query. It formats the output based on user preferences.
- `get_search_context` : Retrieves relevant context based on a search query, returning a JSON string that includes search results formatted as specified.

## Analysts Generation : Human in the Loop
**Analyst Generation** : Create and review analysts using Human-In-The-Loop.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize the model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
```

```python
from typing import List
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from langchain_opentutorial.graphs import visualize_graph


# Class defining analyst properties and metadata
class Analyst(BaseModel):
    # Primary affiliation information
    affiliation: str = Field(
        description="Primary affiliation of the analyst.",
    )
    # Name
    name: str = Field(description="Name of the analyst.")

    # Role
    role: str = Field(
        description="Role of the analyst in the context of the topic.",
    )
    # Description of focus, concerns, and motives
    description: str = Field(
        description="Description of the analyst focus, concerns, and motives.",
    )

    # Property that returns analyst's personal information as a string
    @property
    def persona(self) -> str:
        return f"Name: {self.name}\nRole: {self.role}\nAffiliation: {self.affiliation}\nDescription: {self.description}\n"


# Collection of analysts
class Perspectives(BaseModel):
    # List of analysts
    analysts: List[Analyst] = Field(
        description="Comprehensive list of analysts with their roles and affiliations.",
    )
```

The following defines the state that tracks the collection of analysts generated through the Analyst class:

```python
# State Definition
class GenerateAnalystsState(TypedDict):
    # Research topic
    topic: str
    # Maximum number of analysts to generate
    max_analysts: int
    # Human feedback
    human_analyst_feedback: str
    # List of analysts
    analysts: List[Analyst]
```

### Defining the Analyst Generation Node

Next, we will define the analyst generation node.

The code below implements the logic for generating various analysts based on the provided research topic. Each analyst has a unique role and affiliation, offering professional perspectives on the topic.

```python
from langgraph.graph import END
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

# Analyst generation prompt
analyst_instructions = """You are tasked with creating a set of AI analyst personas. 

Follow these instructions carefully:
1. First, review the research topic:

{topic}
        
2. Examine any editorial feedback that has been optionally provided to guide the creation of the analysts: 
        
{human_analyst_feedback}
    
3. Determine the most interesting themes based upon documents and/or feedback above.
                    
4. Pick the top {max_analysts} themes.

5. Assign one analyst to each theme."""


# Analyst generation node
def create_analysts(state: GenerateAnalystsState):
    """Function to create analyst personas"""

    topic = state["topic"]
    max_analysts = state["max_analysts"]
    human_analyst_feedback = state.get("human_analyst_feedback", "")

    # Apply structured output format to LLM
    structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Perspectives)

    # Construct system prompt for analyst creation
    system_message = analyst_instructions.format(
        topic=topic,
        human_analyst_feedback=human_analyst_feedback,
        max_analysts=max_analysts,
    )

    # Call LLM to generate analyst personas
    analysts = structured_llm.invoke(
        [SystemMessage(content=system_message)]
        + [HumanMessage(content="Generate the set of analysts.")]
    )

    # Store generated list of analysts in state
    return {"analysts": analysts.analysts}


# User feedback node (can be left empty since it will update state)
def human_feedback(state: GenerateAnalystsState):
    """A checkpoint node for receiving user feedback"""
    pass


# Function to decide the next step in the workflow based on human feedback
def should_continue(state: GenerateAnalystsState):
    """Function to determine the next step in the workflow"""

    human_analyst_feedback = state.get("human_analyst_feedback", None)
    if human_analyst_feedback:
        return "create_analysts"

    return END
```

**Explanation of Code Components**

- **Analyst Instructions**: A prompt that guides the LLM in creating AI analyst personas based on a specified research topic and any provided feedback.

- **create_analysts Function**: This function is responsible for generating a set of analysts based on the current state, which includes the research topic, maximum number of analysts, and any human feedback.

- **human_feedback Function**: A placeholder function that can be expanded to handle user feedback.

- **should_continue Function**: This function evaluates whether there is human feedback available and determines whether to proceed with creating analysts or end the process. 

This structure allows for a dynamic approach to generating tailored analyst personas that can provide diverse insights into a given research topic.

### Building the Analyst Generation Graph

Now we'll create the analyst generation graph that orchestrates the research workflow.

```python
from langgraph.graph import START, END, StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

# Create graph
builder = StateGraph(GenerateAnalystsState)

# Add nodes
builder.add_node("create_analysts", create_analysts)
builder.add_node("human_feedback", human_feedback)

# Connect edges
builder.add_edge(START, "create_analysts")
builder.add_edge("create_analysts", "human_feedback")

# Add conditional edge: return to analyst creation node if human feedback exists
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "human_feedback", should_continue, ["create_analysts", END]
)

# Create memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Compile graph (set breakpoints)
graph = builder.compile(interrupt_before=["human_feedback"], checkpointer=memory)

# Visualize graph
visualize_graph(graph)
```


    
![png](./img/output_19_0.png)
    


**Graph Components**

- **Nodes**
    - `create_analysts`: Generates analyst personas based on the research topic
    - `human_feedback`: Checkpoint for receiving user input and feedback

- **Edges**
    - Initial flow from START to analyst creation
    - Connection from analyst creation to human feedback
    - Conditional path back to analyst creation based on feedback

- **Features**
    - Memory persistence using `MemorySaver`
    - Breakpoints before human feedback collection
    - Visual representation of workflow through `visualize_graph`

This graph structure enables an iterative research process with human oversight and feedback integration.

### Running the Analyst Generation Graph
Here's how to execute and manage the analyst generation workflow:

```python
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langchain_opentutorial.messages import random_uuid, invoke_graph


# Configure graph execution settings


config = RunnableConfig(
    recursion_limit=10,
    configurable={"thread_id": random_uuid()},
)


# Set number of analysts


max_analysts = 3


# Define research topic


topic = "What are the differences between Modular RAG and Naive RAG, and what are the benefits of using it at the production level"


# Configure input parameters


inputs = {
    "topic": topic,
    "max_analysts": max_analysts,
}


# Execute graph


invoke_graph(graph, inputs, config)
```

    🔄 Node: __interrupt__ 🔄
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
    ==================================================
</pre>

When `__interrupt__` is displayed, the system is ready to receive human feedback. At this point, you can retrieve the current state and provide feedback to guide the analyst generation process.

```python
# Get current graph state
state = graph.get_state(config)

# Check next node
print(state.next)
```

<pre class="custom">('human_feedback',)
</pre>

To inject human feedback into the graph, we use the `update_state` method with the following key components:

```python
# Update graph state with human feedback
graph.update_state(
    config,
    {
        "human_analyst_feedback": "Add in someone named Teddy Lee from a startup to add an entrepreneur perspective"
    },
    as_node="human_feedback",
)
```




<pre class="custom">{'configurable': {'thread_id': '77b5f1cc-b454-4a81-9d4d-32949e109a66',
      'checkpoint_ns': '',
      'checkpoint_id': '1efd9c73-576d-6e75-8002-4bdd66b12cff'}}</pre>



**Key Parameters**
- `config` : Configuration object containing graph settings
- `human_analyst_feedback` : Key for storing feedback content
- `as_node` : Specifies the node that will process the feedback

**[Note]** : Assigning `None` as input triggers the graph to continue its execution from the last checkpoint. This is particularly useful when you want to resume processing after providing human feedback.

(Continue) To resume the graph execution after the `__interrupt__` :

```python
# Continue execution
invoke_graph(graph, None, config)
```

When `__interrupt__` appears again, you have two options: 

- Option 1: Provide Additional Feedback
    - You can provide more feedback to further refine the analyst personas using the same method as before
- Option 2: Complete the Process

To finish the analyst generation process without additional feedback:

```python
# Set feedback input to None to indicate completion
human_feedback_input = None

# Update graph state with no feedback
graph.update_state(
    config, {"human_analyst_feedback": human_feedback_input}, as_node="human_feedback"
)
```

```python
# Continue final execution
invoke_graph(graph, None, config)
```

**Displaying Final Results**

Get and display the final results from the graph:

```python
# Get final state
final_state = graph.get_state(config)

# Get generated analysts
analysts = final_state.values.get("analysts")

# Print analyst count
print(
    f"Number of analysts generated: {len(analysts)}",
    end="\n================================\n",
)

# Print each analyst's persona

    print(analyst.persona)
    print("- " * 30)

# Get next node state (empty tuple indicates completion)
print(final_state.next)

## Interview Execution

### Define Classes and `question_generation` Node
Let's implement the interview execution components with proper state management and `question_generation` Node:

```python
import operator
from typing import Annotated
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState


class InterviewState(MessagesState):
    """State management for interview process"""

    max_num_turns: int
    context: Annotated[list, operator.add]  # Context list containing source documents
    analyst: Analyst
    interview: str  # String storing interview content
    sections: list  # List of report sections


class SearchQuery(BaseModel):
    """Data class for search queries"""

    search_query: str = Field(None, description="Search query for retrieval.")
```

```python
def generate_question(state: InterviewState):
    """Node for generating interview questions"""

    # System prompt for question generation
    question_instructions = """You are an analyst tasked with interviewing an expert to learn about a specific topic. 

    Your goal is boil down to interesting and specific insights related to your topic.

    1. Interesting: Insights that people will find surprising or non-obvious.
            
    2. Specific: Insights that avoid generalities and include specific examples from the expert.

    Here is your topic of focus and set of goals: {goals}
            
    Begin by introducing yourself using a name that fits your persona, and then ask your question.

    Continue to ask questions to drill down and refine your understanding of the topic.
            
    When you are satisfied with your understanding, complete the interview with: "Thank you so much for your help!"

    Remember to stay in character throughout your response, reflecting the persona and goals provided to you."""

    # Extract state components
    analyst = state["analyst"]
    messages = state["messages"]

    # Generate question using LLM
    system_message = question_instructions.format(goals=analyst.persona)
    question = llm.invoke([SystemMessage(content=system_message)] + messages)

    # Return updated messages
    return {"messages": [question]}
```

**State Management**
- `InterviewState` tracks conversation turns, context, and interview content.
- Annotated context list allows for document accumulation.
- Maintains analyst persona and report sections.

**Question Generation**
- Structured system prompt for consistent interviewing style.
- Persona-aware questioning based on analyst goals.
- Progressive refinement of topic understanding.
- Clear interview conclusion mechanism.

The code provides a robust foundation for conducting structured interviews while maintaining conversation state and context.

### Defining Research Tools

Experts collect information in parallel from multiple sources to answer questions.

They can utilize various tools such as web document scraping, VectorDB, web search, and Wikipedia search.

We'll focus on two main tools: **`Tavily`** for web search and **`ArxivRetriever`** for academic papers.

`Tavily Search`
- Real-time web search capabilities
- Configurable result count and content depth
- Structured output formatting
- Raw content inclusion option

```python
from langchain_opentutorial.tools.tavily import TavilySearch

# Initialize TavilySearch with configuration


tavily_search = TavilySearch(max_results=3)
```

`ArxivRetriever`
- Access to academic papers and research
- Full document retrieval
- Comprehensive metadata access
- Customizable document load limits

```python
from langchain_community.retrievers import ArxivRetriever

# Initialize ArxivRetriever with configuration
arxiv_retriever = ArxivRetriever(
    load_max_docs=3, load_all_available_meta=True, get_full_documents=True
)

# Execute arxiv search and print results
arxiv_search_results = arxiv_retriever.invoke("Modular RAG vs Naive RAG")
print(arxiv_search_results)
```

The substantial applications and the potential of RAG technology have\nattracted considerable research attention. With the introduction of a large number of new algorithms\nand models to improve various facets of RAG systems in recent years, comparing and evaluating\nthese methods under a consistent setting has become increasingly challenging.\nMany works are not open-source or have fixed settings in their open-source code, making it difficult\nto adapt to new data or innovative components. Besides, the datasets and retrieval corpus used often\nvary, with resources being scattered, which can lead researchers to spend excessive time on pre-\nprocessing steps instead of focusing on optimizing their methods. Furthermore, due to the complexity\nof RAG systems, involving multiple steps such as indexing, retrieval, and generation, researchers\noften need to implement many parts of the system themselves. Although there are some existing RAG\ntoolkits like LangChain [4] and LlamaIndex [5], they are typically large and cumbersome, hindering\nresearchers from implementing customized processes and failing to address the aforementioned issues.\n∗Corresponding author\nPreprint.

    (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The increasing
    demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution

    LLMs and other complementary technologies, which in turn
    has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems. However, the rapid
    advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm,
    with many methods struggling to be unified under the process
    of “retrieve-then-generate”. In this context, this paper examines
    the limitations of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces
    the modular RAG framework. By decomposing complex RAG
    systems into independent modules and specialized operators, it
    facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG
    transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a
    more advanced design that integrates routing, scheduling, and
    fusion mechanisms. Drawing on extensive research, this paper
    further identifies prevalent RAG patterns—linear, conditional,

    notably producing “hallucinations” [2] when handling queries
    beyond their training data or requiring current information. To
    overcome challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document chunks from
    external knowledge base through semantic similarity calcu-
    lation. By referencing external knowledge, RAG effectively
    reduces the problem of generating factually incorrect content.
    Its integration into LLMs has resulted in widespread adoption,
    establishing RAG as a key technology in advancing chatbots
    and enhancing the suitability of LLMs for real-world applica-
    tions.
    RAG technology has rapidly developed in recent years, and
    the technology tree summarizing related research is shown

    of large models exhibits several distinct stage characteristics.
    Initially, RAG’s inception coincided with the rise of the
    Transformer architecture, focusing on enhancing language
    models by incorporating additional knowledge through Pre-
    Training Models (PTM). This early stage was characterized
    by foundational work aimed at refining pre-training techniques
    [3]–[5].The subsequent arrival of ChatGPT [6] marked a
    pivotal moment, with LLM demonstrating powerful in context
    learning (ICL) capabilities. RAG research shifted towards
    providing better information for LLMs to answer more com-
    plex and knowledge-intensive tasks during the inference stage,
    leading to rapid development in RAG studies. As research
    progressed, the enhancement of RAG was no longer limited
    to the inference stage but began to incorporate more with LLM
    fine-tuning techniques.
    The burgeoning field of RAG has experienced swift growth,
    yet it has not been accompanied by a systematic synthesis that
    could clarify its broader trajectory. Thi

    Introduction
    In the era of large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [1, 2] has
    emerged as a robust solution to mitigate hallucination issues in LLMs by leveraging external
    knowledge bases [3]. The substantial applications and the potential of RAG technology have
    attracted considerable research attention. With the introduction of a large number of new algorithms
    and models to improve various facets of RAG systems in recent years, comparing and evaluating
    these methods under a consistent setting has become increasingly challenging.
    Many works are not open-source or have fixed settings in their open-source code, making it difficult
    to adapt to new data or innovative components. Besides, the datasets and retrieval corpus used often
    vary, with resources being scattered, which can lead researchers to spend excessive time on pre-
    processing steps instead of focusing on optimizing their methods. Furthermore, due to the complexity
    of RAG systems, involving multiple steps such as indexing, retrieval, and generation, researchers
    often need to implement many parts of the system themselves. Although there are some existing RAG
    toolkits like LangChain [4] and LlamaIndex [5], they are typically large and cumbersome, hindering
    researchers from implementing customized processes and failing to address the aforementioned issues.

    Thus, a unified, researcher-oriented RAG toolkit is urgently needed to streamline methodological
    development and comparative studies.
    To address the issue mentioned above, we introduce FlashRAG, an open-source library designed to
    enable researchers to easily reproduce existing RAG methods and develop their own RAG algorithms.
    This library allows researchers to utilize built pipelines to replicate existing work, employ provided
    RAG components to construct their own RAG processes, or simply use organized datasets and corpora
    to accelerate their own RAG workflow. Compared to existing RAG toolkits, FlashRAG is more suited
    for researchers. To summarize, the key features and capabilities of our FlashRAG library can be
    outlined in the following four aspects:
    Extensive and Customizable Modular RAG Framework.
    To facilitate an easily expandable
    RAG process, we implemented modular RAG at two levels. At the component level, we offer

### Defining Search Tool Nodes

The code implements two main search tool nodes for gathering research information: web search via `Tavily` and academic paper search via `ArXiv`. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage

# Search query instruction
search_instructions = SystemMessage(
    content=f"""You will be given a conversation between an analyst and an expert. 

Your goal is to generate a well-structured query for use in retrieval and / or web-search related to the conversation.
        
First, analyze the full conversation.

Pay particular attention to the final question posed by the analyst.

Convert this final question into a well-structured web search query"""
)


def search_web(state: InterviewState):
    """Performs web search using Tavily"""

    # Generate search query
    structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(SearchQuery)
    search_query = structured_llm.invoke([search_instructions] + state["messages"])

    # Execute search
    search_docs = tavily_search.invoke(search_query.search_query)

    # Format results - handle both string and dict responses
    if isinstance(search_docs, list):
        formatted_search_docs = "\n\n---\n\n".join(
            [
                f'<Document href="{doc["url"]}"/>\n{doc["content"]}\n</Document>'
                for doc in search_docs
            ]
        )

    return {"context": [formatted_search_docs]}


def search_arxiv(state: InterviewState):
    """Performs academic paper search using ArXiv"""

    # Generate search query
    structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(SearchQuery)
    search_query = structured_llm.invoke([search_instructions] + state["messages"])

    try:
        # Execute search
        arxiv_search_results = arxiv_retriever.invoke(
            search_query.search_query,
            load_max_docs=2,
            load_all_available_meta=True,
            get_full_documents=True,
        )

        # Format results
        formatted_search_docs = "\n\n---\n\n".join(
            [
                f'<Document source="{doc.metadata["entry_id"]}" date="{doc.metadata.get("Published", "")}" authors="{doc.metadata.get("Authors", "")}"/>\n<Title>\n{doc.metadata["Title"]}\n</Title>\n\n<Summary>\n{doc.metadata["Summary"]}\n</Summary>\n\n<Content>\n{doc.page_content}\n</Content>\n</Document>'
                for doc in arxiv_search_results
            ]
        )

        return {"context": [formatted_search_docs]}
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"ArXiv search error: {str(e)}")
        return {"context": ["<Error>Failed to retrieve ArXiv search results.</Error>"]}
```

**Key Features**
- Query Generation: Uses LLM to create structured search queries from conversation context
- Error Handling: Robust error management for ArXiv searches
- Result Formatting: Consistent XML-style formatting for both web and academic results
- Metadata Integration: Comprehensive metadata inclusion for academic papers
- State Management: Maintains conversation context through InterviewState

### Define `generate_answer`, `save_interview`, `route_messages`, `write_section` Nodes

- The `generate_answer` node is responsible for creating expert responses during the interview process.

```python
from langchain_core.messages import get_buffer_string
from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage

answer_instructions = """You are an expert being interviewed by an analyst.

Here is analyst area of focus: {goals}. 
        
You goal is to answer a question posed by the interviewer.

To answer question, use this context:
        
{context}

When answering questions, follow these guidelines:
        
1. Use only the information provided in the context. 
        
2. Do not introduce external information or make assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated in the context.

3. The context contain sources at the topic of each individual document.

4. Include these sources your answer next to any relevant statements. For example, for source # 1 use [1]. 

5. List your sources in order at the bottom of your answer. [1] Source 1, [2] Source 2, etc
        
6. If the source is: <Document source="assistant/docs/llama3_1.pdf" page="7"/>' then just list: 
        
[1] assistant/docs/llama3_1.pdf, page 7 
        
And skip the addition of the brackets as well as the Document source preamble in your citation."""


def generate_answer(state: InterviewState):
    """Generates expert responses to analyst questions"""

    # Get analyst and messages from state
    analyst = state["analyst"]
    messages = state["messages"]
    context = state["context"]

    # Generate answer for the question
    system_message = answer_instructions.format(goals=analyst.persona, context=context)
    answer = llm.invoke([SystemMessage(content=system_message)] + messages)

    # Name the message as expert response
    answer.name = "expert"

    # Add message to state
    return {"messages": [answer]}
```

- `save_interview`

```python
def save_interview(state: InterviewState):
    """Saves the interview content"""

    # Get messages from state
    messages = state["messages"]

    # Convert interview to string
    interview = get_buffer_string(messages)

    # Store under interview key
    return {"interview": interview}
```

### Define `generate_answer`, `save_interview`, `route_messages`, `write_section` Nodes
- `route_messages`

```python
def route_messages(state: InterviewState, name: str = "expert"):
    """Routes between questions and answers in the conversation"""

    # Get messages from state
    messages = state["messages"]
    max_num_turns = state.get("max_num_turns", 2)

    # Count expert responses
    num_responses = len(
        [m for m in messages if isinstance(m, AIMessage) and m.name == name]
    )

    # End interview if maximum turns reached
    if num_responses >= max_num_turns:
        return "save_interview"

    # This router runs after each question-answer pair
    # Get the last question to check for conversation end signal
    last_question = messages[-2]

    # Check for conversation end signal
    if "Thank you so much for your help" in last_question.content:
        return "save_interview"
    return "ask_question"
```

- The `write_section` function and its associated instructions implement a structured report generation system.

```python
section_writer_instructions = """You are an expert technical writer. 

Your task is to create a detailed and comprehensive section of a report, thoroughly analyzing a set of source documents.
This involves extracting key insights, elaborating on relevant points, and providing in-depth explanations to ensure clarity and understanding. Your writing should include necessary context, supporting evidence, and examples to enhance the reader's comprehension. Maintain a logical and well-organized structure, ensuring that all critical aspects are covered in detail and presented in a professional tone.

Please follow these instructions:
1. Analyze the content of the source documents: 
- The name of each source document is at the start of the document, with the <Document tag.
        
2. Create a report structure using markdown formatting:
- Use ## for the section title
- Use ### for sub-section headers
        
3. Write the report following this structure:
a. Title (## header)
b. Summary (### header)
c. Comprehensive analysis (### header)
d. Sources (### header)

4. Make your title engaging based upon the focus area of the analyst: 
{focus}

5. For the summary section:
- Set up summary with general background / context related to the focus area of the analyst
- Emphasize what is novel, interesting, or surprising about insights gathered from the interview
- Create a numbered list of source documents, as you use them
- Do not mention the names of interviewers or experts
- Aim for approximately 400 words maximum
- Use numbered sources in your report (e.g., [1], [2]) based on information from source documents

6. For the Comprehensive analysis section:
- Provide a detailed examination of the information from the source documents.
- Break down complex ideas into digestible segments, ensuring a logical flow of ideas.
- Use sub-sections where necessary to cover multiple perspectives or dimensions of the analysis.
- Support your analysis with data, direct quotes, and examples from the source documents.
- Clearly explain the relevance of each point to the overall focus of the report.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity when presenting multiple related ideas.
- Ensure the tone remains professional and objective, avoiding bias or unsupported opinions.
- Aim for at least 800 words to ensure the analysis is thorough.

7. In the Sources section:
- Include all sources used in your report
- Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths
- Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
- It will look like:

### Sources
[1] Link or Document name
[2] Link or Document name

8. Be sure to combine sources. For example this is not correct:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
[4] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/

There should be no redundant sources. It should simply be:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
        
9. Final review:
- Ensure the report follows the required structure
- Include no preamble before the title of the report
- Check that all guidelines have been followed"""


def write_section(state: InterviewState):
    """Generates a structured report section based on interview content"""

    # Get context and analyst from state
    context = state["context"]
    analyst = state["analyst"]

    # Define system prompt for section writing
    system_message = section_writer_instructions.format(focus=analyst.description)
    section = llm.invoke(
        [
            SystemMessage(content=system_message),
            HumanMessage(content=f"Use this source to write your section: {context}"),
        ]
    )

    # Add section to state
    return {"sections": [section.content]}
```

### Building the Interview Graph
Here's how to create and configure the interview execution graph:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

# Add nodes and edges
interview_builder = StateGraph(InterviewState)

# Define nodes
interview_builder.add_node("ask_question", generate_question)
interview_builder.add_node("search_web", search_web)
interview_builder.add_node("search_arxiv", search_arxiv)
interview_builder.add_node("answer_question", generate_answer)
interview_builder.add_node("save_interview", save_interview)
interview_builder.add_node("write_section", write_section)

# Configure flow
interview_builder.add_edge(START, "ask_question")
interview_builder.add_edge("ask_question", "search_web")
interview_builder.add_edge("ask_question", "search_arxiv")
interview_builder.add_edge("search_web", "answer_question")
interview_builder.add_edge("search_arxiv", "answer_question")
interview_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "answer_question", route_messages, ["ask_question", "save_interview"]
)
interview_builder.add_edge("save_interview", "write_section")
interview_builder.add_edge("write_section", END)

# Create interview graph with memory
memory = MemorySaver()
interview_graph = interview_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory).with_config(
    run_name="Conduct Interviews"
)

# Visualize the graph
visualize_graph(interview_graph)
```


    
![png](./img/output_63_0.png)
    


**Graph Structure**

The interview process follows this flow:
1. Question Generation
2. Parallel Search (Web and ArXiv)
3. Answer Generation
4. Conditional Routing
5. Interview Saving
6. Section Writing

**Key Components**
- State Management: Uses InterviewState for tracking
- Memory Persistence: Implements MemorySaver
- Conditional Logic: Routes between questions and interview completion
- Parallel Processing: Conducts simultaneous web and academic searches

Note: Ensure the langgraph module is installed before running this code.

### Executing the Interview Graph
Here's how to execute the graph and display the results:

```python
# Select first analyst from the list
analysts[0]

    Naive RAG is a paradigm that combines information retrieval with natural language generation to produce responses to queries or prompts. In Naive RAG, retrieval is typically performed using retrieval models that rank the indexed data based on its relevance to the input query. These models generate text based on the input query and the retrieved context, aiming to produce coherent and contextually relevant responses. Advanced RAG models may fine-tune embeddings to capture task-specific semantics or domain knowledge, thereby improving the quality of retrieved information and generated responses. Dynamic embedding techniques enable RAG models to adaptively adjust embeddings during inference based on the context of the query or retrieved information.

    <Title>
    A Theory for Token-Level Harmonization in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance
    large language models (LLMs). Studies show that while RAG provides valuable
    external information (benefit), it may also mislead LLMs (detriment) with noisy
    or incorrect retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to
    preserve benefit and avoid detriment, they lack a theoretical explanation for
    RAG. The benefit and detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a
    black box that cannot be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so
    existing methods are data-driven, need additional utility evaluators or
    post-hoc. This paper takes the first step towards providing a theory to explain
    and trade off the benefit and detriment in RAG. First, we model RAG as the
    fusion between distribution of LLMs knowledge and distribution of retrieved
    texts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the value of external knowledge
    (benefit) and its potential risk of misleading LLMs (detriment) in next token
    prediction of RAG by distribution difference in this fusion. Finally, we prove
    that the actual effect of RAG on the token, which is the comparison between
    benefit and detriment, can be predicted without any training or accessing the
    utility of retrieval. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel method,
    Tok-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between the pure LLM and RAG
    at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments in
    real-world tasks using LLMs such as OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the
    effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical findings.

    ABSTRACT
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance large
    language models (LLMs). Studies show that while RAG provides valuable external
    information (benefit), it may also mislead LLMs (detriment) with noisy or incorrect
    retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to preserve benefit and

    driven, need additional utility evaluators or post-hoc. This paper takes the first step
    towards providing a theory to explain and trade off the benefit and detriment in
    RAG. First, we model RAG as the fusion between distribution of LLM’s knowledge
    and distribution of retrieved texts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the

    INTRODUCTION
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown promising performance in enhancing Large
    Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieved texts (Xu et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Asai et al.,
    2023; Ram et al., 2023). Studies indicate that while RAG provides LLMs with valuable additional
    knowledge (benefit), it also poses a risk of misleading them (detriment) due to noisy or incorrect
    retrieved texts (Ram et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024b;a; Jin et al., 2024a; Xie et al., 2023; Jin et al.,
    2024b). Existing methods attempt to preserve benefit and avoid detriment by adding utility evaluators
    for retrieval, prompt engineering, or fine-tuning LLMs (Asai et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2024; Xu et al.,
    2024b; Yoran et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023).
    However, existing methods are data-driven, need evaluator for utility of retrieved texts or post-hoc. A
    theory-based method, focusing on core principles of RAG is urgently needed, which is crucial for
    consistent and reliable improvements without relying on additional training or utility evaluators and
    improving our understanding for RAG.
    This paper takes the first step in providing a theoretical framework to explain and trade off the benefit
    and detriment at token level in RAG and proposes a novel method to preserve benefit and avoid
    detriment based on our theoretical findings. Specifically, this paper pioneers in modeling next token
    prediction in RAG as the fusion between the distribution of LLM’s knowledge and the distribution
    of retrieved texts as shown in Figure 1. Our theoretical derivation based on this formalizes the core
    of this fusion as the subtraction between two terms measured by the distribution difference: one is
    distribution completion and the other is distribution contradiction. Further analysis indicates that
    the distribution completion measures how much out-of-distribution knowledge that retrieved texts

    Modular RAG: Transforming RAG Systems into LEGO-like Reconfigurable Frameworks
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities
    of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The
    increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG,
    leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary
    technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems.
    However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm,
    with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of
    "retrieve-then-generate". In this context, this paper examines the limitations
    of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By
    decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized
    operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG
    transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced
    design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on
    extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG
    patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive
    analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents
    innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG
    systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators
    and paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical
    roadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG
    technologies.

    ARGE Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
    remarkable capabilities, yet they still face numerous
    challenges, such as hallucination and the lag in information up-
    dates [1]. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG), by access-
    ing external knowledge bases, provides LLMs with important
    contextual information, significantly enhancing their perfor-
    mance on knowledge-intensive tasks [2]. Currently, RAG, as
    an enhancement method, has been widely applied in various
    practical application scenarios, including knowledge question
    answering, recommendation systems, customer service, and
    personal assistants. [3]–[6]
    During the nascent stages of RAG , its core framework is
    constituted by indexing, retrieval, and generation, a paradigm
    referred to as Naive RAG [7]. However, as the complexity
    of tasks and the demands of applications have escalated, the

    limitations of Naive RAG have become increasingly apparent.
    As depicted in Figure 1, it predominantly hinges on the
    straightforward similarity of chunks, result in poor perfor-
    mance when confronted with complex queries and chunks with
    substantial variability. The primary challenges of Naive RAG
    include: 1) Shallow Understanding of Queries. The semantic
    similarity between a query and document chunk is not always
    highly consistent. Relying solely on similarity calculations
    for retrieval lacks an in-depth exploration of the relationship
    between the query and the document [8]. 2) Retrieval Re-
    dundancy and Noise. Feeding all retrieved chunks directly
    into LLMs is not always beneficial. Research indicates that
    an excess of redundant and noisy information may interfere
    with the LLM’s identification of key information, thereby
    increasing the risk of generating erroneous and hallucinated
    responses. [9]

    Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Many language models now enhance their responses with retrieval capabilities,
    leading to the widespread adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    systems. However, despite retrieval being a core component of RAG, much of the
    research in this area overlooks the extensive body of work on fair ranking,
    neglecting the importance of considering all stakeholders involved. This paper
    presents the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems integrated with fair
    rankings. We focus specifically on measuring the fair exposure of each relevant
    item across the rankings utilized by RAG systems (i.e., item-side fairness),
    aiming to promote equitable growth for relevant item providers. To gain a deep
    understanding of the relationship between item-fairness, ranking quality, and
    generation quality in the context of RAG, we analyze nine different RAG systems
    that incorporate fair rankings across seven distinct datasets. Our findings
    indicate that RAG systems with fair rankings can maintain a high level of
    generation quality and, in many cases, even outperform traditional RAG systems,
    despite the general trend of a tradeoff between ensuring fairness and
    maintaining system-effectiveness. We believe our insights lay the groundwork
    for responsible and equitable RAG systems and open new avenues for future
    research. We publicly release our codebase and dataset at

    Introduction
    In recent years, the concept of fair ranking has emerged as a critical concern in modern information
    access systems [12]. However, despite its significance, fair ranking has yet to be thoroughly examined
    in the context of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [1, 29], a rapidly advancing trend in natural
    language processing (NLP) systems [27]. To understand why this is important, consider the RAG
    system in Figure 1, where a user asks a question about running shoes. A classic retrieval system
    might return several documents containing information from various running shoe companies. If the
    RAG system only selects the top two documents, then information from the remaining two relevant
    companies will not be relayed to the predictive model and will likely be omitted from its answer.
    The fair ranking literature refers to this situation as unfair because some relevant companies (i.e., in
    documents at position 3 and 4) receive less or no exposure compared to equally relevant company in
    the top position [12].
    Understanding the effect of fair ranking in RAG is fundamental to ensuring responsible and equitable
    NLP systems. Since retrieval results in RAG often underlie response attribution [15], unfair exposure
    of content to the RAG system can result in incomplete evidence in responses (thus compromising recall
    of potentially relevant information for users) or downstream representational harms (thus creating
    or reinforcing biases across the set of relevant entities). In situations where content providers are
    compensated for contributions to inference, there can be financial implications for the unfairness
    [4, 19, 31]. Indeed, the fair ranking literature indicates that these are precisely the harms that emerge

    Certainly, Dr. Zhang. The fundamental differences between Modular RAG and Naive RAG primarily lie in their architectural design and flexibility.
    
    1. **Architecture and Design**:
       - **Naive RAG**: This approach combines information retrieval with natural language generation, using retrieval models that rank data based on relevance to the input query. It generally has a linear architecture, where the process is "retrieve-then-generate," which may limit its ability to handle complex queries with substantial variability [4].
       - **Modular RAG**: This framework transforms RAG systems into reconfigurable, LEGO-like structures by decomposing them into independent modules and specialized operators. It transcends the traditional linear architecture by incorporating advanced design elements like routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. This modularity allows for greater flexibility and customization, enabling the system to adapt more effectively to specific tasks or industries [2][3].
    
    2. **Performance and Benefits**:
       - **Naive RAG** faces challenges such as shallow understanding of queries and retrieval redundancy, which can introduce noise and reduce the quality of generated responses. Its rigid architecture limits customization and adaptation to domain-specific needs, making it less suitable for complex or specialized applications [5].
       - **Modular RAG** offers significant advantages in production settings due to its reconfigurable nature. The modular design allows for the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs, and other technologies, improving efficiency and scalability. This adaptability makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from knowledge-intensive tasks to industry-specific solutions, by allowing easy incorporation of custom modules tailored to specific requirements [2][3].
    
    Overall, Modular RAG's enhanced flexibility and capability to manage complex tasks make it a more robust choice for production-level deployments, providing a foundation for scalable and efficient AI systems.

    Naive RAG established the groundwork for retrieval-augmented systems by combining document retrieval with language model generation. For example, in a question-answering task, RECALL ensures that a RAG system accurately incorporates all relevant points from retrieved documents into the generated answer. Vector databases play a crucial role in the operation of RAG systems, providing the infrastructure required for storing and retrieving high-dimensional embeddings of contextual information needed for LLMs. These embeddings capture the semantic and contextual meaning of unstructured data, enabling precise similarity searches that underpin the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation. By integrating retrieval into generation, RAG systems deliver more accurate and context-aware outputs, making them effective for applications requiring current or specialized knowledge.

    Introduction
    1.1 Introduction of Natural Language Generation (NLG)
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become a pivotal domain within artificial intelligence (AI), with
    applications ranging from simple text classification to more complex tasks such as summarization,
    machine translation, and question answering. A particularly significant branch of NLP is Natural Language
    Generation (NLG), which focuses on the production of human-like language from structured or
    unstructured data. NLG's goal is to enable machines to generate coherent, relevant, and context-aware
    text, improving interactions between humans and machines (Gatt et. al. 2018). As AI evolves, the demand
    for more contextually aware and factually grounded generated content has increased, bringing about new
    challenges and innovations in NLG.
    Traditional NLG models, especially sequence-to-sequence architectures (Sutskever et al. 2014), have
    exhibited significant advancements in generating fluent and coherent text. However, these models tend to
    rely heavily on training data, often struggling when tasked with generating factually accurate or
    contextually rich content for queries that require knowledge beyond their training set. As a result, models
    like GPT (Radford et al. 2019) or BERT-based (Devlin et al. 2019) text generators are prone to
    hallucinations, where they produce plausible but incorrect or non-existent information (Ji et al. 2022). This
    limitation has prompted the exploration of hybrid models that combine retrieval mechanisms with
    generative capabilities to ensure both fluency and factual correctness in outputs. There has been a
    significant rise in several research papers in this field and several new methods across the RAG
    components have been proposed. Apart from new algorithms and methods, RAG has also seen steep
    adoption across various applications. However, there is a gap in a sufficient survey of this space tracking
    the evolution and recent changes in this space. The current survey intends to fill this gap.

    Introduction
    The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) with increasingly longer context lengths has
    opened new possibilities for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. Recent models
    such as Anthropic Claude (200k tokens) [1], GPT-4-turbo (128k tokens) [2], OpenAI o1 (128k tokens)
    [3], Llama 3 [4] and Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (2 million tokens) [5] have led to speculation about
    whether long context models might eventually subsume traditional RAG workflows entirely. In this
    study, we empirically investigate the impact of increased context length on RAG performance and
    explore the limitations and challenges that arise in long context scenarios.
    RAG can enhance the accuracy of LLMs by retrieving information from external sources, enabling
    users to incorporate task-specific or private data into their LLM workflows. Published results using
    RAG-like methods have demonstrated benefits across many applications [6] including machine

    applications. While there has been recent speculation that long context LLMs will replace RAG
    entirely [14], in this paper we study whether long context LLMs can indeed be used effectively for
    RAG systems. How well do the best open source and commercial models do on long-context RAG
    tasks?
    In this study, we apply a standard RAG approach and evaluate the performance of 20 popular open
    source and commercial LLMs with varying context lengths from 2,000 to 128,000 tokens (and 2
    million tokens when possible). We then analyze distinct failure modes for different models across
    long context RAG scenarios. We show that:

    models we evaluated first increase and then decrease RAG performance as context length

    Certainly, Dr. Zhang. A real-world application where Modular RAG's adaptability significantly enhances performance compared to Naive RAG is in the domain of customer support chatbots.
    
    In this scenario, customer support chatbots need to handle a wide variety of queries that may require accessing domain-specific knowledge or integrating with other systems. Naive RAG, with its linear "retrieve-then-generate" architecture, may struggle to efficiently handle the diversity of queries due to its reliance on straightforward similarity measures and the potential noise from redundant information [5]. This can lead to less relevant or slower responses, impacting customer satisfaction.
    
    Modular RAG, on the other hand, excels in this environment due to its reconfigurable nature. By decomposing the RAG system into independent modules, it allows for the integration of specialized operators and advanced retrievers tailored to the chatbot's specific domain or industry requirements. This modularity facilitates better routing and scheduling of tasks, ensuring that the most relevant information is retrieved and generated efficiently. As a result, Modular RAG can deliver more precise and contextually relevant responses, improving both the speed and quality of the customer service experience [3].
    
    The adaptability of Modular RAG also enables the chatbot to scale more effectively, as new modules can be added or existing ones refined without overhauling the entire system. This scalability is crucial for businesses looking to expand their support capabilities or integrate new technologies over time [2][3].

    Naive RAG established the groundwork for retrieval-augmented systems by combining document retrieval with language model generation. For example, in a question-answering task, RECALL ensures that a RAG system accurately incorporates all relevant points from retrieved documents into the generated answer. Vector databases play a crucial role in the operation of RAG systems, providing the infrastructure required for storing and retrieving high-dimensional embeddings of contextual information needed for LLMs. These embeddings capture the semantic and contextual meaning of unstructured data, enabling precise similarity searches that underpin the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation. By integrating retrieval into generation, RAG systems deliver more accurate and context-aware outputs, making them effective for applications requiring current or specialized knowledge.

    No Free Lunch: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Undermines Fairness in LLMs, Even for Vigilant Users

    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely adopted for its effectiveness
    and cost-efficiency in mitigating hallucinations and enhancing the
    domain-specific generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
    However, is this effectiveness and cost-efficiency truly a free lunch? In this
    study, we comprehensively investigate the fairness costs associated with RAG by
    proposing a practical three-level threat model from the perspective of user
    awareness of fairness. Specifically, varying levels of user fairness awareness
    result in different degrees of fairness censorship on the external dataset. We
    examine the fairness implications of RAG using uncensored, partially censored,
    and fully censored datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that fairness
    alignment can be easily undermined through RAG without the need for fine-tuning
    or retraining. Even with fully censored and supposedly unbiased external
    datasets, RAG can lead to biased outputs. Our findings underscore the
    limitations of current alignment methods in the context of RAG-based LLMs and
    highlight the urgent need for new strategies to ensure fairness. We propose
    potential mitigations and call for further research to develop robust fairness
    safeguards in RAG-based LLMs.

    Introduction
    Large language models (LLMs) such as Llama and ChatGPT have demonstrated significant success across a wide range
    of AI applications[1, 2]. However, these models still suffer from inherent limitations, including hallucinations[3] and the
    presence of outdated information[4]. To mitigate these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been
    introduced, which retrieves relevant knowledge from external datasets to enhance LLMs’ generative capabilities. This
    approach has drawn considerable attention due to its effectiveness and cost-efficiency[5]. Notably, both OpenAI[6] and
    Meta[7] advocate for RAG as a effective technique for improving model performance. However, is the effectiveness and
    efficiency of RAG truly a free lunch? RAG has been widely utilized in fairness-sensitive areas such as healthcare[8, 9],
    education[10], and finance[11]. Hence, a critical question arises: what potential side effects does RAG have on
    trustworthiness, particularly on fairness?

    Tremendous efforts have been devoted to align LLMs with human values to prevent harmful content generation,
    including discrimination, bias, and stereotypes. Established techniques such as reinforcement learning from human
    feedback (RLHF)[12] and instruction tuning[13] have been proven to significantly improve LLMs alignment. However,
    recent studies[14, 15, 16] reveal that this “impeccable alignment” can be easily compromised through fine-tuning or
    retraining. This vulnerability arises primarily because fine-tuning can alter the weights associated with the original
    alignment, resulting in degraded performance. However, what happens when we employ RAG, which does not modify
    the LLMs’ weights and thus maintains the “impeccable alignment”? Can fairness still be compromised? These questions
    raise a significant concern: if RAG can inadvertently lead LLMs to generate biased outputs, it indicates that

    I. INTRODUCTION 
    INTEGRATING Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education 
    holds immense potential for revolutionizing personalized 
    learning. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) promise 
    adaptive learning paths and on-demand support, empowering 
    students to learn at their own pace and receive assistance 
    whenever needed. However, realizing this potential is hindered 
    by two key challenges: (1) Information Hallucination: Large 
     
     
     
    Language Models (LLMs), the engines behind many AI tutors, 
    can generate plausible but factually incorrect information [4], 
    eroding trust and hindering effective learning. (2) Course-
    Specific Adaptation: Existing general-purpose AI tools often 
    lack the necessary alignment with specific course content and 
    pedagogical approaches, limiting their practical application in 
    diverse educational settings [3]. To bridge this gap, we propose 
    KG-RAG (Knowledge Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented 
    Generation), a novel framework that combines knowledge 
    graphs with retrieval-augmented generation. Our approach is 
    grounded in constructivist learning theory [18], emphasizing 
    that learners build understanding through structured, context-
    rich interactions. The key contributions of our work include: 
     
    1) A novel KG-RAG architecture that enhances response 
    accuracy and pedagogical coherence by grounding LLM 
    outputs in course-specific knowledge graphs 
    2) An 
    efficient 
    implementation 
    using 
    Qwen2.5, 
    demonstrating superior performance at significantly lower 
    operational costs 
    3) Comprehensive empirical evaluation through controlled 
    experiments and user studies, providing quantitative 
    evidence of improved learning outcomes 
    4) Practical 
    insights 
    into 
    deployment 
    considerations, 
    including cost optimization strategies and privacy 
    preservation measures 
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 
    II surveys existing AI tutoring approaches and their limitations. 
    Section III presents the technical foundations of our framework.

    Enhancing Retrieval and Managing Retrieval: A Four-Module Synergy for Improved Quality and Efficiency in RAG Systems
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques leverage the in-context
    learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to produce more accurate
    and relevant responses. Originating from the simple 'retrieve-then-read'
    approach, the RAG framework has evolved into a highly flexible and modular
    paradigm. A critical component, the Query Rewriter module, enhances knowledge
    retrieval by generating a search-friendly query. This method aligns input
    questions more closely with the knowledge base. Our research identifies
    opportunities to enhance the Query Rewriter module to Query Rewriter+ by
    generating multiple queries to overcome the Information Plateaus associated
    with a single query and by rewriting questions to eliminate Ambiguity, thereby
    clarifying the underlying intent. We also find that current RAG systems exhibit
    issues with Irrelevant Knowledge; to overcome this, we propose the Knowledge
    Filter. These two modules are both based on the instruction-tuned Gemma-2B
    model, which together enhance response quality. The final identified issue is
    Redundant Retrieval; we introduce the Memory Knowledge Reservoir and the
    Retriever Trigger to solve this. The former supports the dynamic expansion of
    the RAG system's knowledge base in a parameter-free manner, while the latter
    optimizes the cost for accessing external knowledge, thereby improving resource
    utilization and response efficiency. These four RAG modules synergistically
    improve the response quality and efficiency of the RAG system. The
    effectiveness of these modules has been validated through experiments and
    ablation studies across six common QA datasets. The source code can be accessed

    Introduction
    Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant leap in ar-
    tificial intelligence, with breakthroughs in generalization and adapt-
    ability across diverse tasks [4, 6]. However, challenges such as hal-
    lucinations [32], temporal misalignments [27], context processing
    issues [1], and fine-tuning inefficiencies [8] have raised significant
    concerns about their reliability. In response, recent research has fo-
    cused on enhancing LLMs’ capabilities by integrating them with ex-
    ternal knowledge sources through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    (RAG) [2, 20, 13, 15]. This approach significantly improves LLMs’
    ability to answer questions more accurately and contextually.

    [20, 15, 13]. However, this vanilla pipeline has low retrieval qual-
    ity and produces unreliable answers. To transcend this, more ad-
    vanced RAG modules have been developed and integrated into the
    basic pipeline. For example, the Query Rewriter module acts as a
    bridge between the input question and the retrieval module. Instead
    of directly using the original question as the query text, it gener-
    ates a new query that better facilitates the retrieval of relevant infor-
    mation. This enhancement forms the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read pipeline
    [23, 22]. Furthermore, models like RETA-LLM [22] and RARR [10]
    integrate a post-reading and fact-checking component to further so-
    lidify the reliability of responses. Additional auxiliary modules such
    as the query router [21] and the resource ranker 1 [14] have also been
    proposed to be integrated into the RAG’s framework to improve the
    practicality in complex application scenario. This integration of var-
    ious modules into the RAG pipeline leading to the emergence of a
    modular RAG paradigm [11], transforming the RAG framework into
    a highly flexible system.

    Certainly, Dr. Zhang. Modular RAG introduces several computational efficiencies that can translate to cost savings and enhanced user experience:
    
    1. **Efficient Resource Utilization**: By employing specialized modules and operators, Modular RAG can dynamically allocate resources based on the specific needs of each task. This means that computational power is used more effectively, focusing on retrieving and processing only the most relevant information. This efficiency reduces unnecessary computational load, which can directly lead to cost savings in terms of reduced resource consumption [2].
    
    2. **Reduced Redundancy and Noise**: Modular RAG's architecture includes mechanisms to filter out redundant and noisy data before it reaches the language model. This reduces the computational effort required to process extraneous information, allowing the system to operate more quickly and with less strain on computational resources. As a result, users experience faster response times, which enhances the overall user experience [5].
    
    3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: The modular structure of Modular RAG allows organizations to scale their systems up or down easily, adding new capabilities or adjusting existing ones without needing to redesign the entire architecture. This flexibility not only optimizes the use of computational resources but also means that businesses can adapt quickly to changes in demand or new technological advancements, maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness [3].
    
    4. **Improved Query Handling**: By utilizing advanced routing and scheduling mechanisms, Modular RAG can prioritize and route queries more effectively. This ensures that complex or high-priority queries receive the necessary computational attention, while simpler tasks are handled with minimal resource allocation. This targeted approach enhances processing efficiency, thereby improving the user experience with quicker and more accurate responses [2].
    
    These computational efficiencies make Modular RAG not only a more powerful option for handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks but also a cost-effective solution for businesses looking to optimize their AI deployments.

    Naive RAG is a paradigm that combines information retrieval with natural language generation to produce responses to queries or prompts. In Naive RAG, retrieval is typically performed using retrieval models that rank the indexed data based on its relevance to the input query. These models generate text based on the input query and the retrieved context, aiming to produce coherent and contextually relevant responses. Advanced RAG models may fine-tune embeddings to capture task-specific semantics or domain knowledge, thereby improving the quality of retrieved information and generated responses. Dynamic embedding techniques enable RAG models to adaptively adjust embeddings during inference based on the context of the query or retrieved information.

    Naive RAG established the groundwork for retrieval-augmented systems by combining document retrieval with language model generation. For example, in a question-answering task, RECALL ensures that a RAG system accurately incorporates all relevant points from retrieved documents into the generated answer. Vector databases play a crucial role in the operation of RAG systems, providing the infrastructure required for storing and retrieving high-dimensional embeddings of contextual information needed for LLMs. These embeddings capture the semantic and contextual meaning of unstructured data, enabling precise similarity searches that underpin the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation. By integrating retrieval into generation, RAG systems deliver more accurate and context-aware outputs, making them effective for applications requiring current or specialized knowledge.

    A Theory for Token-Level Harmonization in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance
    large language models (LLMs). Studies show that while RAG provides valuable
    external information (benefit), it may also mislead LLMs (detriment) with noisy
    or incorrect retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to
    preserve benefit and avoid detriment, they lack a theoretical explanation for
    RAG. The benefit and detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a
    black box that cannot be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so
    existing methods are data-driven, need additional utility evaluators or
    post-hoc. This paper takes the first step towards providing a theory to explain
    and trade off the benefit and detriment in RAG. First, we model RAG as the
    fusion between distribution of LLMs knowledge and distribution of retrieved
    texts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the value of external knowledge
    (benefit) and its potential risk of misleading LLMs (detriment) in next token
    prediction of RAG by distribution difference in this fusion. Finally, we prove
    that the actual effect of RAG on the token, which is the comparison between
    benefit and detriment, can be predicted without any training or accessing the
    utility of retrieval. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel method,
    Tok-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between the pure LLM and RAG
    at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments in
    real-world tasks using LLMs such as OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the
    effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical findings.

    ABSTRACT
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance large
    language models (LLMs). Studies show that while RAG provides valuable external
    information (benefit), it may also mislead LLMs (detriment) with noisy or incorrect
    retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to preserve benefit and
    avoid detriment, they lack a theoretical explanation for RAG. The benefit and
    detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a ’black box’ that cannot
    be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so existing methods are data-
    driven, need additional utility evaluators or post-hoc. This paper takes the first step
    towards providing a theory to explain and trade off the benefit and detriment in
    RAG. First, we model RAG as the fusion between distribution of LLM’s knowledge
    and distribution of retrieved texts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the
    value of external knowledge (benefit) and its potential risk of misleading LLMs
    (detriment) in next token prediction of RAG by distribution difference in this
    fusion. Finally, we prove that the actual effect of RAG on the token, which is the
    comparison between benefit and detriment, can be predicted without any training or
    accessing the utility of retrieval. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel
    method, Tok-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between the pure
    LLM and RAG at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments
    in real-world tasks using LLMs such as OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the
    effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical findings.

    INTRODUCTION
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown promising performance in enhancing Large
    Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieved texts (Xu et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Asai et al.,
    2023; Ram et al., 2023). Studies indicate that while RAG provides LLMs with valuable additional
    knowledge (benefit), it also poses a risk of misleading them (detriment) due to noisy or incorrect
    retrieved texts (Ram et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024b;a; Jin et al., 2024a; Xie et al., 2023; Jin et al.,
    2024b). Existing methods attempt to preserve benefit and avoid detriment by adding utility evaluators
    for retrieval, prompt engineering, or fine-tuning LLMs (Asai et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2024; Xu et al.,
    2024b; Yoran et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023).
    However, existing methods are data-driven, need evaluator for utility of retrieved texts or post-hoc. A
    theory-based method, focusing on core principles of RAG is urgently needed, which is crucial for
    consistent and reliable improvements without relying on additional training or utility evaluators and
    improving our understanding for RAG.
    This paper takes the first step in providing a theoretical framework to explain and trade off the benefit
    and detriment at token level in RAG and proposes a novel method to preserve benefit and avoid
    detriment based on our theoretical findings. Specifically, this paper pioneers in modeling next token
    prediction in RAG as the fusion between the distribution of LLM’s knowledge and the distribution
    of retrieved texts as shown in Figure 1. Our theoretical derivation based on this formalizes the core
    of this fusion as the subtraction between two terms measured by the distribution difference: one is
    distribution completion and the other is distribution contradiction. Further analysis indicates that
    the distribution completion measures how much out-of-distribution knowledge that retrieved texts

    Modular RAG: Transforming RAG Systems into LEGO-like Reconfigurable Frameworks
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities
    of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The
    increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG,
    leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary
    technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems.
    However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm,
    with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of
    "retrieve-then-generate". In this context, this paper examines the limitations
    of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By
    decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized
    operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG
    transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced
    design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on
    extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG
    patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive
    analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents
    innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG
    systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators
    and paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical
    roadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG

    ARGE Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
    remarkable capabilities, yet they still face numerous
    challenges, such as hallucination and the lag in information up-
    dates [1]. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG), by access-
    ing external knowledge bases, provides LLMs with important
    contextual information, significantly enhancing their perfor-
    mance on knowledge-intensive tasks [2]. Currently, RAG, as
    an enhancement method, has been widely applied in various
    practical application scenarios, including knowledge question
    answering, recommendation systems, customer service, and
    personal assistants. [3]–[6]
    During the nascent stages of RAG , its core framework is
    constituted by indexing, retrieval, and generation, a paradigm
    referred to as Naive RAG [7]. However, as the complexity
    of tasks and the demands of applications have escalated, the

    limitations of Naive RAG have become increasingly apparent.
    As depicted in Figure 1, it predominantly hinges on the
    straightforward similarity of chunks, result in poor perfor-
    mance when confronted with complex queries and chunks with
    substantial variability. The primary challenges of Naive RAG
    include: 1) Shallow Understanding of Queries. The semantic
    similarity between a query and document chunk is not always
    highly consistent. Relying solely on similarity calculations
    for retrieval lacks an in-depth exploration of the relationship
    between the query and the document [8]. 2) Retrieval Re-
    dundancy and Noise. Feeding all retrieved chunks directly
    into LLMs is not always beneficial. Research indicates that
    an excess of redundant and noisy information may interfere
    with the LLM’s identification of key information, thereby
    increasing the risk of generating erroneous and hallucinated
    responses. [9]

    INTRODUCTION
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an effective way to use
    large language models (LLMs) to answer questions while avoiding
    hallucinations and factual inaccuracy[12, 20, 46]. Basic RAG is sim-
    ple: 1) search a knowledge base for relevant content; 2) compose a
    prompt grounded in the retrieved content; and 3) prompt an LLM to
    generate output. For the retrieval step, one approach dominates the
    literature: 1) segment content text into chunks; 2) index vectorized
    chunks for search in a vector database; and 3) when generating
    answers, ground prompts in a subset of retrieved chunks[13]. Our
    RAG solutions don’t always use vector databases for search.
    Wikipedia has long been influenced by and had an influence on
    scientific research [21, 41]. With respect to RAG, Wikipedia is a dom-
    inant source of knowledge base content for training data and bench-
    marks, including: 2WikiMultiHopQA, AmbigQA, ASQA, DART,

    RAG solutions is our own product documentation, which is struc-
    tured differently from Wikipedia articles.
    Using common benchmarks to test your RAG implementation
    involves these steps: 1) index the given knowledge base content in
    your retriever component; 2) prompt your solution to answer the
    given questions; and 3) compare generated answers to expected

    interview:
    Human: So you said you were writing an article on What are the differences between Modular RAG and Naive RAG, and what are the benefits of using it at production level?
    AI: Hello, my name is Alex Turner, and I'm an analyst interested in learning about the fascinating world of AI architectures. Dr. Zhang, could you explain the fundamental differences between Modular RAG and Naive RAG, particularly in terms of their architecture and how these differences impact their performance?
    AI: Certainly, Dr. Zhang. The fundamental differences between Modular RAG and Naive RAG primarily lie in their architectural design and flexibility.
    
    1. **Architecture and Design**:
       - **Naive RAG**: This approach combines information retrieval with natural language generation, using retrieval models that rank data based on relevance to the input query. It generally has a linear architecture, where the process is "retrieve-then-generate," which may limit its ability to handle complex queries with substantial variability [4].
       - **Modular RAG**: This framework transforms RAG systems into reconfigurable, LEGO-like structures by decomposing them into independent modules and specialized operators. It transcends the traditional linear architecture by incorporating advanced design elements like routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. This modularity allows for greater flexibility and customization, enabling the system to adapt more effectively to specific tasks or industries [2][3].
    
    2. **Performance and Benefits**:
       - **Naive RAG** faces challenges such as shallow understanding of queries and retrieval redundancy, which can introduce noise and reduce the quality of generated responses. Its rigid architecture limits customization and adaptation to domain-specific needs, making it less suitable for complex or specialized applications [5].
       - **Modular RAG** offers significant advantages in production settings due to its reconfigurable nature. The modular design allows for the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs, and other technologies, improving efficiency and scalability. This adaptability makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from knowledge-intensive tasks to industry-specific solutions, by allowing easy incorporation of custom modules tailored to specific requirements [2][3].
    
    Overall, Modular RAG's enhanced flexibility and capability to manage complex tasks make it a more robust choice for production-level deployments, providing a foundation for scalable and efficient AI systems.

    AI: Thank you for clarifying these distinctions, Dr. Zhang. Could you provide an example of a real-world application where Modular RAG's adaptability significantly enhances performance compared to Naive RAG? Specifically, how does its modularity contribute to better scalability or efficiency in that scenario?
    AI: Certainly, Dr. Zhang. A real-world application where Modular RAG's adaptability significantly enhances performance compared to Naive RAG is in the domain of customer support chatbots.
    
    In this scenario, customer support chatbots need to handle a wide variety of queries that may require accessing domain-specific knowledge or integrating with other systems. Naive RAG, with its linear "retrieve-then-generate" architecture, may struggle to efficiently handle the diversity of queries due to its reliance on straightforward similarity measures and the potential noise from redundant information [5]. This can lead to less relevant or slower responses, impacting customer satisfaction.
    
    Modular RAG, on the other hand, excels in this environment due to its reconfigurable nature. By decomposing the RAG system into independent modules, it allows for the integration of specialized operators and advanced retrievers tailored to the chatbot's specific domain or industry requirements. This modularity facilitates better routing and scheduling of tasks, ensuring that the most relevant information is retrieved and generated efficiently. As a result, Modular RAG can deliver more precise and contextually relevant responses, improving both the speed and quality of the customer service experience [3].
    
    The adaptability of Modular RAG also enables the chatbot to scale more effectively, as new modules can be added or existing ones refined without overhauling the entire system. This scalability is crucial for businesses looking to expand their support capabilities or integrate new technologies over time [2][3].

    AI: That's a fascinating example of how Modular RAG can offer tangible benefits in a real-world setting. Could you elaborate on any specific computational efficiencies that Modular RAG introduces, and how these might translate to cost savings or enhanced user experience in practice?
    AI: Certainly, Dr. Zhang. Modular RAG introduces several computational efficiencies that can translate to cost savings and enhanced user experience:
    
    1. **Efficient Resource Utilization**: By employing specialized modules and operators, Modular RAG can dynamically allocate resources based on the specific needs of each task. This means that computational power is used more effectively, focusing on retrieving and processing only the most relevant information. This efficiency reduces unnecessary computational load, which can directly lead to cost savings in terms of reduced resource consumption [2].
    
    2. **Reduced Redundancy and Noise**: Modular RAG's architecture includes mechanisms to filter out redundant and noisy data before it reaches the language model. This reduces the computational effort required to process extraneous information, allowing the system to operate more quickly and with less strain on computational resources. As a result, users experience faster response times, which enhances the overall user experience [5].
    
    3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: The modular structure of Modular RAG allows organizations to scale their systems up or down easily, adding new capabilities or adjusting existing ones without needing to redesign the entire architecture. This flexibility not only optimizes the use of computational resources but also means that businesses can adapt quickly to changes in demand or new technological advancements, maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness [3].
    
    4. **Improved Query Handling**: By utilizing advanced routing and scheduling mechanisms, Modular RAG can prioritize and route queries more effectively. This ensures that complex or high-priority queries receive the necessary computational attention, while simpler tasks are handled with minimal resource allocation. This targeted approach enhances processing efficiency, thereby improving the user experience with quicker and more accurate responses [2].
    
    These computational efficiencies make Modular RAG not only a more powerful option for handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks but also a cost-effective solution for businesses looking to optimize their AI deployments.

    ### Comprehensive Analysis
    
    The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems has led to significant advancements in how large language models (LLMs) integrate external information to enhance their generative capabilities. This section delves into the architectural and operational differences between Naive RAG and Modular RAG, emphasizing their impact on computational efficiency and adaptability.
    
    #### Naive RAG: Foundations and Limitations
    
    Naive RAG represents the initial phase of RAG systems, primarily characterized by its "retrieve-then-generate" approach. This model combines document retrieval with language model generation, aiming to produce coherent and contextually relevant responses. However, several challenges undermine its effectiveness:
    
    - **Shallow Understanding of Queries**: Naive RAG relies heavily on semantic similarity for retrieval, which can result in inadequate exploration of the query-document relationship. This limitation often leads to a failure in capturing nuanced query intents, affecting the accuracy of the generated responses [2].
      
    - **Retrieval Redundancy and Noise**: The process of feeding all retrieved chunks into LLMs can introduce excessive noise, potentially misleading the model and increasing the risk of generating hallucinated responses. This redundancy highlights the need for more refined retrieval mechanisms [5].
    
    - **Inflexibility**: The rigid architecture of Naive RAG restricts its adaptability to diverse and dynamic datasets, making it less suitable for specialized tasks or industries [4].
    
    #### Modular RAG: A Reconfigurable Framework
    
    Modular RAG addresses these limitations by introducing a highly reconfigurable framework that decomposes RAG systems into independent modules and specialized operators. This modular approach offers several advantages:
    
    - **Advanced Design**: By integrating routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms, Modular RAG transcends the traditional linear architecture, allowing for more sophisticated data handling and processing [2].
    
    - **Customization and Scalability**: The modularity of the system enables organizations to tailor RAG systems to specific application needs, enhancing relevance, response times, and customer satisfaction. This adaptability is crucial for scaling RAG systems across various domains [4].
    
    - **Enhanced Retrieval and Generation**: The modular framework supports the inclusion of advanced retrievers and complementary technologies, improving the overall performance of RAG systems in handling complex queries and variable data [3].
    
    #### Token-Level Harmonization Theory
    
    A significant theoretical advancement in RAG systems is the introduction of a token-level harmonization theory. This approach models RAG as a fusion between the distribution of LLM knowledge and retrieved texts. It formalizes the trade-off between the value of external knowledge (benefit) and its potential to mislead LLMs (detriment) in next token prediction. This theoretical framework allows for a more explainable and quantifiable comparison of benefits and detriments, facilitating a balanced integration of external data [1].
    
    #### Implications for AI Applications
    
    The transition from Naive to Modular RAG represents a paradigm shift in how LLMs are utilized in AI applications. Modular RAG's adaptability and efficiency make it a preferable choice for tasks requiring high scalability and specialization. The ongoing research into token-level harmonization further enhances the precision and reliability of RAG systems, paving the way for more robust and contextually aware AI solutions.

### Parallel Interviewing by `map-reduce`
Here's how to implement parallel interviews using map-reduce in LangGraph:

```python
import operator
from typing import List, Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict


class ResearchGraphState(TypedDict):
    """State definition for research graph"""

    # Research topic
    topic: str
    # Maximum number of analysts
    max_analysts: int
    # Human analyst feedback
    human_analyst_feedback: str
    # List of questioning analysts
    analysts: List[Analyst]
    # List of sections containing Send() API keys
    sections: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    # Report components
    introduction: str
    content: str
    conclusion: str
    final_report: str
```

Let me explain how the `Send()` function is used in LangGraph for parallel interview execution:

**Reference**
- [LangGraph `Send()`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#send)

```python
from langgraph.constants import Send


def initiate_all_interviews(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """Initiates parallel interviews for all analysts"""

    # Check for human feedback
    human_analyst_feedback = state.get("human_analyst_feedback")

    # Return to analyst creation if human feedback exists
    if human_analyst_feedback:
        return "create_analysts"

    # Otherwise, initiate parallel interviews using Send()
    else:
        topic = state["topic"]
        return [
            Send(
                "conduct_interview",
                {
                    "analyst": analyst,
                    "messages": [
                        HumanMessage(
                            content=f"So you said you were writing an article on {topic}?"
                        )
                    ],
                },
            )
            for analyst in state["analysts"]
        ]
```

## Report Writing

Next, we will define the guidelines for writing a report based on the interview content and define a function for report writing.

### Define Nodes
- Main Report Content

```python
report_writer_instructions = """You are a technical writer creating a report on this overall topic:

{topic}

You have a team of analysts. Each analyst has done two things:

1. They conducted an interview with an expert on a specific sub-topic.
2. They write up their finding into a memo.

Your task:

1. You will be given a collection of memos from your analysts.  
2. Carefully review and analyze the insights from each memo.  
3. Consolidate these insights into a detailed and comprehensive summary that integrates the central ideas from all the memos.  
4. Organize the key points from each memo into the appropriate sections provided below, ensuring that each section is logical and well-structured.  
5. Include all required sections in your report, using `### Section Name` as the header for each.  
6. Aim for approximately 250 words per section, providing in-depth explanations, context, and supporting details.  

**Sections to consider (including optional ones for greater depth):**

- **Background**: Theoretical foundations, key concepts, and preliminary information necessary to understand the methodology and results.
- **Related Work**: Overview of prior studies and how they compare or relate to the current research.
- **Problem Definition**: A formal and precise definition of the research question or problem the paper aims to address.
- **Methodology (or Methods)**: Detailed description of the methods, algorithms, models, data collection processes, or experimental setups used in the study.
- **Implementation Details**: Practical details of how the methods or models were implemented, including software frameworks, computational resources, or parameter settings.
- **Experiments**: Explanation of experimental protocols, datasets, evaluation metrics, procedures, and configurations employed to validate the methods.
- **Results**: Presentation of experimental outcomes, often with statistical tables, graphs, figures, or qualitative analyses.

To format your report:

1. Use markdown formatting.
2. Include no pre-amble for the report.
3. Use no sub-heading.
4. Start your report with a single title header: ## Insights
5. Do not mention any analyst names in your report.
6. Preserve any citations in the memos, which will be annotated in brackets, for example [1] or [2].
7. Create a final, consolidated list of sources and add to a Sources section with the `## Sources` header.
8. List your sources in order and do not repeat.

[1] Source 1
[2] Source 2

Here are the memos from your analysts to build your report from:

{context}"""


def write_report(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """Generates main report content from interview sections"""
    sections = state["sections"]
    topic = state["topic"]

    # Combine all sections
    formatted_str_sections = "\n\n".join([f"{section}" for section in sections])

    # Generate report from sections
    system_message = report_writer_instructions.format(
        topic=topic, context=formatted_str_sections
    )
    report = llm.invoke(
        [
            SystemMessage(content=system_message),
            HumanMessage(content="Write a report based upon these memos."),
        ]
    )
    return {"content": report.content}
```

- Introduction Generation

```python
intro_conclusion_instructions = """You are a technical writer finishing a report on {topic}

You will be given all of the sections of the report.

You job is to write a crisp and compelling introduction or conclusion section.

The user will instruct you whether to write the introduction or conclusion.

Include no pre-amble for either section.

Target around 200 words, crisply previewing (for introduction),  or recapping (for conclusion) all of the sections of the report.

Use markdown formatting.

For your introduction, create a compelling title and use the # header for the title.

For your introduction, use ## Introduction as the section header.

For your conclusion, use ## Conclusion as the section header.

Here are the sections to reflect on for writing: {formatted_str_sections}"""


def write_introduction(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """Creates report introduction"""
    sections = state["sections"]
    topic = state["topic"]

    formatted_str_sections = "\n\n".join([f"{section}" for section in sections])

    instructions = intro_conclusion_instructions.format(
        topic=topic, formatted_str_sections=formatted_str_sections
    )
    intro = llm.invoke(
        [instructions, HumanMessage(content="Write the report introduction")]
    )
    return {"introduction": intro.content}


def write_conclusion(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """Creates report conclusion"""
    sections = state["sections"]
    topic = state["topic"]

    formatted_str_sections = "\n\n".join([f"{section}" for section in sections])

    instructions = intro_conclusion_instructions.format(
        topic=topic, formatted_str_sections=formatted_str_sections
    )
    conclusion = llm.invoke(
        [instructions, HumanMessage(content="Write the report conclusion")]
    )
    return {"conclusion": conclusion.content}
```

- Final Report Assembly

```python
def finalize_report(state: ResearchGraphState):
    """Assembles final report with all components"""
    content = state["content"]

    # Clean up content formatting
    if content.startswith("## Insights"):
        content = content.strip("## Insights")

    # Handle sources section
    if "## Sources" in content:
        try:
            content, sources = content.split("\n## Sources\n")
        except:
            sources = None
    else:
        sources = None

    # Assemble final report
    final_report = (
        state["introduction"]
        + "\n\n---\n\n## Main Idea\n\n"
        + content
        + "\n\n---\n\n"
        + state["conclusion"]
    )

    # Add sources if available
    if sources is not None:
        final_report += "\n\n## Sources\n" + sources

    return {"final_report": final_report}
```

Each function handles a specific aspect of report generation:
- Content synthesis from interview sections
- Introduction creation
- Conclusion development
- Final assembly with proper formatting and structure

### Building the Report Writing Graph
Here's the implementation of the research graph that orchestrates the entire workflow: 

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.constants import START, END
from langchain_opentutorial.graphs import visualize_graph

# Create graph
builder = StateGraph(ResearchGraphState)

# Define nodes
builder.add_node("create_analysts", create_analysts)
builder.add_node("human_feedback", human_feedback)
builder.add_node("conduct_interview", interview_builder.compile())
builder.add_node("write_report", write_report)
builder.add_node("write_introduction", write_introduction)
builder.add_node("write_conclusion", write_conclusion)
builder.add_node("finalize_report", finalize_report)

# Define edges
builder.add_edge(START, "create_analysts")
builder.add_edge("create_analysts", "human_feedback")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "human_feedback", initiate_all_interviews, ["create_analysts", "conduct_interview"]
)

# Report generation from interviews
builder.add_edge("conduct_interview", "write_report")
builder.add_edge("conduct_interview", "write_introduction")
builder.add_edge("conduct_interview", "write_conclusion")

# Final report assembly
builder.add_edge(
    ["write_conclusion", "write_report", "write_introduction"], "finalize_report"
)
builder.add_edge("finalize_report", END)

# Compile graph
memory = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(interrupt_before=["human_feedback"], checkpointer=memory)

# Visualize the workflow
visualize_graph(graph)
```

The graph structure implements:

**Core Workflow Stages**
- Analyst Creation
- Human Feedback Integration
- Parallel Interview Execution
- Report Generation
- Final Assembly

**Key Components**
- State Management using ResearchGraphState
- Memory persistence with MemorySaver
- Conditional routing based on human feedback
- Parallel processing of interviews
- Synchronized report assembly

**Flow Control**
- Starts with analyst creation
- Allows for human feedback and iteration
- Conducts parallel interviews
- Generates report components simultaneously
- Assembles final report with all components

This implementation creates a robust workflow for automated research with human oversight and parallel processing capabilities.

### Executing the Report Writing  Graph

 Here's how to run the graph with the specified parameters: 

```python
# Set input parameters
max_analysts = 3
topic = "Explain how Modular RAG differs from traditional Naive RAG and the benefits of using it at the production level."

# Configure execution settings
config = RunnableConfig(
    recursion_limit=30,
    configurable={"thread_id": random_uuid()},
)

# Prepare input data
inputs = {"topic": topic, "max_analysts": max_analysts}

# Execute graph until first breakpoint

    Naive RAG is a paradigm that combines information retrieval with natural language generation to produce responses to queries or prompts. In Naive RAG, retrieval is typically performed using retrieval models that rank the indexed data based on its relevance to the input query. These models generate text based on the input query and the retrieved context, aiming to produce coherent and contextually relevant responses. Advanced RAG models may fine-tune embeddings to capture task-specific semantics or domain knowledge, thereby improving the quality of retrieved information and generated responses. Dynamic embedding techniques enable RAG models to adaptively adjust embeddings during inference based on the context of the query or retrieved information.

    Modular RAG: Transforming RAG Systems into LEGO-like Reconfigurable Frameworks
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities
    of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The
    increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG,
    leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary
    technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems.
    However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm,
    with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of
    "retrieve-then-generate". In this context, this paper examines the limitations
    of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By
    decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized
    operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG
    transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced
    design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on
    extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG
    patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive
    analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents
    innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG
    systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators
    and paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical
    roadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG

    ARGE Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
    remarkable capabilities, yet they still face numerous
    challenges, such as hallucination and the lag in information up-
    dates [1]. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG), by access-
    ing external knowledge bases, provides LLMs with important
    contextual information, significantly enhancing their perfor-
    mance on knowledge-intensive tasks [2]. Currently, RAG, as
    an enhancement method, has been widely applied in various
    practical application scenarios, including knowledge question
    answering, recommendation systems, customer service, and
    personal assistants. [3]–[6]
    During the nascent stages of RAG , its core framework is
    constituted by indexing, retrieval, and generation, a paradigm
    referred to as Naive RAG [7]. However, as the complexity
    of tasks and the demands of applications have escalated, the

    limitations of Naive RAG have become increasingly apparent.
    As depicted in Figure 1, it predominantly hinges on the
    straightforward similarity of chunks, result in poor perfor-
    mance when confronted with complex queries and chunks with
    substantial variability. The primary challenges of Naive RAG
    include: 1) Shallow Understanding of Queries. The semantic
    similarity between a query and document chunk is not always
    highly consistent. Relying solely on similarity calculations
    for retrieval lacks an in-depth exploration of the relationship
    between the query and the document [8]. 2) Retrieval Re-
    dundancy and Noise. Feeding all retrieved chunks directly
    into LLMs is not always beneficial. Research indicates that
    an excess of redundant and noisy information may interfere
    with the LLM’s identification of key information, thereby
    increasing the risk of generating erroneous and hallucinated
    responses. [9]

    <Title>
    A Theory for Token-Level Harmonization in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance
    large language models (LLMs). Studies show that while RAG provides valuable
    external information (benefit), it may also mislead LLMs (detriment) with noisy
    or incorrect retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to
    preserve benefit and avoid detriment, they lack a theoretical explanation for
    RAG. The benefit and detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a
    black box that cannot be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so
    existing methods are data-driven, need additional utility evaluators or
    post-hoc. This paper takes the first step towards providing a theory to explain
    and trade off the benefit and detriment in RAG. First, we model RAG as the
    fusion between distribution of LLMs knowledge and distribution of retrieved
    texts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the value of external knowledge
    (benefit) and its potential risk of misleading LLMs (detriment) in next token
    prediction of RAG by distribution difference in this fusion. Finally, we prove
    that the actual effect of RAG on the token, which is the comparison between
    benefit and detriment, can be predicted without any training or accessing the
    utility of retrieval. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel method,
    Tok-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between the pure LLM and RAG
    at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments in
    real-world tasks using LLMs such as OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the
    effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical findings.

    ABSTRACT
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance large
    language models (LLMs). Studies show that while RAG provides valuable external
    information (benefit), it may also mislead LLMs (detriment) with noisy or incorrect
    retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to preserve benefit and
    avoid detriment, they lack a theoretical explanation for RAG. The benefit and
    detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a ’black box’ that cannot
    be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so existing methods are data-
    driven, need additional utility evaluators or post-hoc. This paper takes the first step
    towards providing a theory to explain and trade off the benefit and detriment in
    RAG. First, we model RAG as the fusion between distribution of LLM’s knowledge
    and distribution of retrieved texts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the
    value of external knowledge (benefit) and its potential risk of misleading LLMs
    (detriment) in next token prediction of RAG by distribution difference in this
    fusion. Finally, we prove that the actual effect of RAG on the token, which is the
    comparison between benefit and detriment, can be predicted without any training or
    accessing the utility of retrieval. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel
    method, Tok-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between the pure
    LLM and RAG at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments
    in real-world tasks using LLMs such as OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the
    effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical findings.

    INTRODUCTION
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown promising performance in enhancing Large
    Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieved texts (Xu et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Asai et al.,
    2023; Ram et al., 2023). Studies indicate that while RAG provides LLMs with valuable additional
    knowledge (benefit), it also poses a risk of misleading them (detriment) due to noisy or incorrect
    retrieved texts (Ram et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024b;a; Jin et al., 2024a; Xie et al., 2023; Jin et al.,
    2024b). Existing methods attempt to preserve benefit and avoid detriment by adding utility evaluators
    for retrieval, prompt engineering, or fine-tuning LLMs (Asai et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2024; Xu et al.,
    2024b; Yoran et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023).
    However, existing methods are data-driven, need evaluator for utility of retrieved texts or post-hoc. A
    theory-based method, focusing on core principles of RAG is urgently needed, which is crucial for
    consistent and reliable improvements without relying on additional training or utility evaluators and
    improving our understanding for RAG.
    This paper takes the first step in providing a theoretical framework to explain and trade off the benefit
    and detriment at token level in RAG and proposes a novel method to preserve benefit and avoid
    detriment based on our theoretical findings. Specifically, this paper pioneers in modeling next token
    prediction in RAG as the fusion between the distribution of LLM’s knowledge and the distribution
    of retrieved texts as shown in Figure 1. Our theoretical derivation based on this formalizes the core
    of this fusion as the subtraction between two terms measured by the distribution difference: one is
    distribution completion and the other is distribution contradiction. Further analysis indicates that
    the distribution completion measures how much out-of-distribution knowledge that retrieved texts

    Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Many language models now enhance their responses with retrieval capabilities,
    leading to the widespread adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    systems. However, despite retrieval being a core component of RAG, much of the
    research in this area overlooks the extensive body of work on fair ranking,
    neglecting the importance of considering all stakeholders involved. This paper
    presents the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems integrated with fair
    rankings. We focus specifically on measuring the fair exposure of each relevant
    item across the rankings utilized by RAG systems (i.e., item-side fairness),
    aiming to promote equitable growth for relevant item providers. To gain a deep
    understanding of the relationship between item-fairness, ranking quality, and
    generation quality in the context of RAG, we analyze nine different RAG systems
    that incorporate fair rankings across seven distinct datasets. Our findings
    indicate that RAG systems with fair rankings can maintain a high level of
    generation quality and, in many cases, even outperform traditional RAG systems,
    despite the general trend of a tradeoff between ensuring fairness and
    maintaining system-effectiveness. We believe our insights lay the groundwork
    for responsible and equitable RAG systems and open new avenues for future
    research. We publicly release our codebase and dataset at

    Introduction
    In recent years, the concept of fair ranking has emerged as a critical concern in modern information
    access systems [12]. However, despite its significance, fair ranking has yet to be thoroughly examined
    in the context of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [1, 29], a rapidly advancing trend in natural
    language processing (NLP) systems [27]. To understand why this is important, consider the RAG
    system in Figure 1, where a user asks a question about running shoes. A classic retrieval system
    might return several documents containing information from various running shoe companies. If the
    RAG system only selects the top two documents, then information from the remaining two relevant
    companies will not be relayed to the predictive model and will likely be omitted from its answer.
    The fair ranking literature refers to this situation as unfair because some relevant companies (i.e., in
    documents at position 3 and 4) receive less or no exposure compared to equally relevant company in
    the top position [12].
    Understanding the effect of fair ranking in RAG is fundamental to ensuring responsible and equitable
    NLP systems. Since retrieval results in RAG often underlie response attribution [15], unfair exposure
    of content to the RAG system can result in incomplete evidence in responses (thus compromising recall
    of potentially relevant information for users) or downstream representational harms (thus creating
    or reinforcing biases across the set of relevant entities). In situations where content providers are
    compensated for contributions to inference, there can be financial implications for the unfairness
    [4, 19, 31]. Indeed, the fair ranking literature indicates that these are precisely the harms that emerge

    Certainly, Dr. Mehta. Modular RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, represents an advancement over the traditional Naive RAG by addressing some of its inherent limitations, such as inflexibility and inefficiencies in handling diverse and dynamic datasets [3].
    
    **Differences:**
    
    1. **Flexibility and Efficiency:** Naive RAG systems are often limited in their ability to efficiently process diverse datasets due to a more rigid architecture. Modular RAG improves upon this by introducing a more flexible framework that can efficiently handle a wider variety of data inputs and adjust to dynamic data changes [3].
    
    2. **Embedding Techniques:** Advanced RAG models, including Modular RAG, often employ fine-tuned embeddings. These embeddings capture task-specific semantics or domain knowledge, which improves the quality of both the retrieved information and the generated responses. Modular RAG can adaptively adjust these embeddings during inference based on the context, leading to more relevant outputs [1].
    
    **Benefits at the Production Level:**
    
    1. **Reduced Computational Overhead:** By optimizing the retrieval and generation processes, Modular RAG can reduce computational overhead, making the system more efficient and cost-effective for large-scale deployment. This is particularly important in production environments where resource efficiency is crucial [1][2].
    
    2. **Improved Processing Speeds:** Modular RAG systems can achieve faster processing speeds due to their ability to handle data more efficiently and adapt to changes dynamically. This is advantageous in production settings where quick response times are essential [2].
    
    3. **Enhanced Accuracy and Context-Awareness:** By integrating retrieval into the generation process and using sophisticated embedding techniques, Modular RAG can provide more accurate and context-aware outputs. This makes it particularly effective for applications that require current or specialized knowledge, such as real-time customer support or complex data analysis [2].
    
    In summary, the transition from Naive to Modular RAG in production environments enhances flexibility, efficiency, and accuracy, thereby making AI systems more viable for large-scale deployment.

    Certainly, Prof. Hinton. Modular RAG differs from traditional Naive RAG in several key ways that enhance its effectiveness in production environments.
    
    1. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Naive RAG, while foundational, often struggles with inflexibility and inefficiencies when dealing with diverse and dynamic datasets. Modular RAG, on the other hand, improves upon this by allowing for more adaptable and flexible integration of retrieval and generation components. This modularity facilitates the customization of each component to better handle various data types and query contexts [3].
    
    2. **Dynamic Embedding Techniques**: Modular RAG employs dynamic embedding techniques that enable the system to adjust embeddings during inference based on the specific context of the query or the retrieved information. This results in more contextually relevant and coherent responses, which is a significant improvement over the static nature of embeddings in Naive RAG [1].
    
    3. **Integration with Vector Databases**: Another benefit of Modular RAG is the integration with vector databases, which provides the necessary infrastructure for storing and retrieving high-dimensional embeddings of contextual information. This integration allows for precise similarity searches, leading to more accurate and context-aware outputs. This capability is crucial for applications that require current or specialized knowledge [2].
    
    Overall, the modular nature of this approach allows for greater scalability and efficiency in AI models, making it particularly suited for production environments where adaptability and performance are essential.

    These sub-modules allow for more granular control over the RAG process, enabling the system to fine-tune its operations based on the specific requirements of the task​. This pattern closely resembles the traditional RAG process but benefits from the modular approach by allowing individual modules to be optimized or replaced without altering the overall flow. For example, a linear RAG flow might begin with a query expansion module to refine the user’s input, followed by the retrieval module, which fetches the most relevant data chunks. The Modular RAG framework embraces this need through various tuning patterns that enhance the system’s ability to adapt to specific tasks and datasets. Managing these different data types and ensuring seamless integration within the RAG system can be difficult, requiring sophisticated data processing and retrieval strategies​(modular rag paper).

    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities

    ARGE Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
    remarkable capabilities, yet they still face numerous
    challenges, such as hallucination and the lag in information up-
    dates [1]. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG), by access-
    ing external knowledge bases, provides LLMs with important
    contextual information, significantly enhancing their perfor-
    mance on knowledge-intensive tasks [2]. Currently, RAG, as
    an enhancement method, has been widely applied in various
    practical application scenarios, including knowledge question
    answering, recommendation systems, customer service, and
    personal assistants. [3]–[6]
    During the nascent stages of RAG , its core framework is
    constituted by indexing, retrieval, and generation, a paradigm
    referred to as Naive RAG [7]. However, as the complexity
    of tasks and the demands of applications have escalated, the

    limitations of Naive RAG have become increasingly apparent.
    As depicted in Figure 1, it predominantly hinges on the
    straightforward similarity of chunks, result in poor perfor-
    mance when confronted with complex queries and chunks with
    substantial variability. The primary challenges of Naive RAG
    include: 1) Shallow Understanding of Queries. The semantic
    similarity between a query and document chunk is not always
    highly consistent. Relying solely on similarity calculations
    for retrieval lacks an in-depth exploration of the relationship
    between the query and the document [8]. 2) Retrieval Re-
    dundancy and Noise. Feeding all retrieved chunks directly
    into LLMs is not always beneficial. Research indicates that
    an excess of redundant and noisy information may interfere
    with the LLM’s identification of key information, thereby
    increasing the risk of generating erroneous and hallucinated
    responses. [9]

    Introduction
    In the era of large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [1, 2] has
    emerged as a robust solution to mitigate hallucination issues in LLMs by leveraging external
    knowledge bases [3]. The substantial applications and the potential of RAG technology have
    attracted considerable research attention. With the introduction of a large number of new algorithms
    and models to improve various facets of RAG systems in recent years, comparing and evaluating
    these methods under a consistent setting has become increasingly challenging.
    Many works are not open-source or have fixed settings in their open-source code, making it difficult
    to adapt to new data or innovative components. Besides, the datasets and retrieval corpus used often
    vary, with resources being scattered, which can lead researchers to spend excessive time on pre-
    processing steps instead of focusing on optimizing their methods. Furthermore, due to the complexity
    of RAG systems, involving multiple steps such as indexing, retrieval, and generation, researchers
    often need to implement many parts of the system themselves. Although there are some existing RAG
    toolkits like LangChain [4] and LlamaIndex [5], they are typically large and cumbersome, hindering
    researchers from implementing customized processes and failing to address the aforementioned issues.

    Thus, a unified, researcher-oriented RAG toolkit is urgently needed to streamline methodological
    development and comparative studies.
    To address the issue mentioned above, we introduce FlashRAG, an open-source library designed to
    enable researchers to easily reproduce existing RAG methods and develop their own RAG algorithms.
    This library allows researchers to utilize built pipelines to replicate existing work, employ provided
    RAG components to construct their own RAG processes, or simply use organized datasets and corpora
    to accelerate their own RAG workflow. Compared to existing RAG toolkits, FlashRAG is more suited
    for researchers. To summarize, the key features and capabilities of our FlashRAG library can be
    outlined in the following four aspects:

    <Title>
    A Theory for Token-Level Harmonization in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance
    large language models (LLMs). Studies show that while RAG provides valuable
    external information (benefit), it may also mislead LLMs (detriment) with noisy
    or incorrect retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to
    preserve benefit and avoid detriment, they lack a theoretical explanation for
    RAG. The benefit and detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a
    black box that cannot be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so
    existing methods are data-driven, need additional utility evaluators or
    post-hoc. This paper takes the first step towards providing a theory to explain
    and trade off the benefit and detriment in RAG. First, we model RAG as the
    fusion between distribution of LLMs knowledge and distribution of retrieved
    texts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the value of external knowledge
    (benefit) and its potential risk of misleading LLMs (detriment) in next token
    prediction of RAG by distribution difference in this fusion. Finally, we prove
    that the actual effect of RAG on the token, which is the comparison between
    benefit and detriment, can be predicted without any training or accessing the
    utility of retrieval. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel method,
    Tok-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between the pure LLM and RAG
    at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments in
    real-world tasks using LLMs such as OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the
    effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical findings.

    retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to preserve benefit and
    avoid detriment, they lack a theoretical explanation for RAG. The benefit and
    detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a ’black box’ that cannot
    be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so existing methods are data-
    driven, need additional utility evaluators or post-hoc. This paper takes the first step
    towards providing a theory to explain and trade off the benefit and detriment in
    RAG. First, we model RAG as the fusion between distribution of LLM’s knowledge
    and distribution of retrieved texts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the
    value of external knowledge (benefit) and its potential risk of misleading LLMs
    (detriment) in next token prediction of RAG by distribution difference in this
    fusion. Finally, we prove that the actual effect of RAG on the token, which is the
    comparison between benefit and detriment, can be predicted without any training or
    accessing the utility of retrieval. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel
    method, Tok-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between the pure
    LLM and RAG at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments
    in real-world tasks using LLMs such as OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the
    effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical findings.

    INTRODUCTION
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown promising performance in enhancing Large
    Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieved texts (Xu et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Asai et al.,
    2023; Ram et al., 2023). Studies indicate that while RAG provides LLMs with valuable additional
    knowledge (benefit), it also poses a risk of misleading them (detriment) due to noisy or incorrect
    retrieved texts (Ram et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024b;a; Jin et al., 2024a; Xie et al., 2023; Jin et al.,
    2024b). Existing methods attempt to preserve benefit and avoid detriment by adding utility evaluators
    for retrieval, prompt engineering, or fine-tuning LLMs (Asai et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2024; Xu et al.,
    2024b; Yoran et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023).
    However, existing methods are data-driven, need evaluator for utility of retrieved texts or post-hoc. A
    theory-based method, focusing on core principles of RAG is urgently needed, which is crucial for
    consistent and reliable improvements without relying on additional training or utility evaluators and
    improving our understanding for RAG.
    This paper takes the first step in providing a theoretical framework to explain and trade off the benefit
    and detriment at token level in RAG and proposes a novel method to preserve benefit and avoid
    detriment based on our theoretical findings. Specifically, this paper pioneers in modeling next token
    prediction in RAG as the fusion between the distribution of LLM’s knowledge and the distribution
    of retrieved texts as shown in Figure 1. Our theoretical derivation based on this formalizes the core
    of this fusion as the subtraction between two terms measured by the distribution difference: one is
    distribution completion and the other is distribution contradiction. Further analysis indicates that
    the distribution completion measures how much out-of-distribution knowledge that retrieved texts

    Introduction
    In the era of large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [1, 2] has
    emerged as a robust solution to mitigate hallucination issues in LLMs by leveraging external
    knowledge bases [3]. The substantial applications and the potential of RAG technology have
    attracted considerable research attention. With the introduction of a large number of new algorithms
    and models to improve various facets of RAG systems in recent years, comparing and evaluating
    these methods under a consistent setting has become increasingly challenging.
    Many works are not open-source or have fixed settings in their open-source code, making it difficult
    to adapt to new data or innovative components. Besides, the datasets and retrieval corpus used often
    vary, with resources being scattered, which can lead researchers to spend excessive time on pre-
    processing steps instead of focusing on optimizing their methods. Furthermore, due to the complexity
    of RAG systems, involving multiple steps such as indexing, retrieval, and generation, researchers
    often need to implement many parts of the system themselves. Although there are some existing RAG
    toolkits like LangChain [4] and LlamaIndex [5], they are typically large and cumbersome, hindering
    researchers from implementing customized processes and failing to address the aforementioned issues.

    Thus, a unified, researcher-oriented RAG toolkit is urgently needed to streamline methodological
    development and comparative studies.
    To address the issue mentioned above, we introduce FlashRAG, an open-source library designed to
    enable researchers to easily reproduce existing RAG methods and develop their own RAG algorithms.
    This library allows researchers to utilize built pipelines to replicate existing work, employ provided
    RAG components to construct their own RAG processes, or simply use organized datasets and corpora
    to accelerate their own RAG workflow. Compared to existing RAG toolkits, FlashRAG is more suited
    for researchers. To summarize, the key features and capabilities of our FlashRAG library can be
    outlined in the following four aspects:

    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities
    of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The
    increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG,
    leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary
    technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems.
    However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm,
    with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of
    "retrieve-then-generate". In this context, this paper examines the limitations
    of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By
    decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized
    operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG
    transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced
    design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on
    extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG
    patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive
    analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents
    innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG
    systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators

    I. INTRODUCTION
    L
    ARGE Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
    remarkable capabilities, yet they still face numerous
    challenges, such as hallucination and the lag in information up-
    dates [1]. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG), by access-
    ing external knowledge bases, provides LLMs with important
    contextual information, significantly enhancing their perfor-
    mance on knowledge-intensive tasks [2]. Currently, RAG, as
    an enhancement method, has been widely applied in various
    practical application scenarios, including knowledge question
    answering, recommendation systems, customer service, and
    personal assistants. [3]–[6]
    During the nascent stages of RAG , its core framework is
    constituted by indexing, retrieval, and generation, a paradigm
    referred to as Naive RAG [7]. However, as the complexity
    of tasks and the demands of applications have escalated, the

    limitations of Naive RAG have become increasingly apparent.
    As depicted in Figure 1, it predominantly hinges on the
    straightforward similarity of chunks, result in poor perfor-
    mance when confronted with complex queries and chunks with
    substantial variability. The primary challenges of Naive RAG
    include: 1) Shallow Understanding of Queries. The semantic
    similarity between a query and document chunk is not always
    highly consistent. Relying solely on similarity calculations
    for retrieval lacks an in-depth exploration of the relationship
    between the query and the document [8]. 2) Retrieval Re-
    dundancy and Noise. Feeding all retrieved chunks directly
    into LLMs is not always beneficial. Research indicates that
    an excess of redundant and noisy information may interfere
    with the LLM’s identification of key information, thereby
    increasing the risk of generating erroneous and hallucinated
    responses. [9]

    This study aims to improve knowledge-based question-answering (QA) systems by
    overcoming the limitations of existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    models and implementing an advanced RAG system based on Graph technology to
    develop high-quality generative AI services. While existing RAG models

    I. Introduction 
    Recent advancements in AI technology have brought sig-
    nificant attention to Generative AI. Generative AI, a form 
    of artificial intelligence that can create new content such 
    as text, images, audio, and video based on vast amounts 
    of trained data models (Jeong, 2023d), is being applied in 
    various fields, including daily conversations, finance, 
    healthcare, education, and entertainment (Ahn & Park, 
    2023). As generative AI services become more accessible 
    to the general public, the role of generative AI-based chat-
    bots is becoming increasingly important (Adam et al., 
    2021; Przegalinska et al., 2019; Park, 2024). A chatbot is 
    an intelligent agent that allows users to have conversa-
    tions typically through text or voice (Sánchez-Díaz et al., 
    2018; Jeong & Jeong, 2020). Recently, generative AI 
    chatbots have advanced to the level of analyzing human 
    emotions and intentions to provide responses (Jeong, 
    2023a). With the advent of large language models 
    (LLMs), these chatbots can now be utilized for automatic 
     
    Cheonsu Jeong

    dialogue generation and translation (Jeong, 2023b). How-
    ever, they may generate responses that conflict with the 
    latest information and have a low understanding of new 
    problems or domains as they rely on previously trained 
    data (Jeong, 2023c). While 2023 was marked by the re-
    lease of foundational large language models (LLMs) like 
    ChatGPT and Llama-2, experts predict that 2024 will be 
    the year of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 
    AI Agents (Skelter Labs, 2024). 
    However, there are several considerations for companies 
    looking to adopt generative AI services. Companies must 
    address concerns such as whether the AI can provide ac-
    curate responses based on internal data, the potential risk 
    of internal data leakage, and how to integrate generative 
    AI with corporate systems. Solutions include using do-
    main-specific fine-tuned LLMs and enhancing reliability 
    with RAG that utilizes internal information (Jung, 2024). 
    When domain-specific information is fine-tuned on GPT-
    4 LLM, accuracy improves from 75% to 81%, and adding 
    RAG can further increase accuracy to 86% (Angels et al., 
    2024). RAG models are known for effectively combinin

    Certainly, let's explore the differences between Modular RAG and traditional Naive RAG in terms of architecture and their implications for production environments.
    
    **Architectural Differences:**
    
    1. **Structure and Modularity:**
       - **Naive RAG:** This approach is characterized by a rigid and linear architecture, typically following a straightforward "retrieve-then-generate" process. This limits flexibility and adaptability, as each component of the system is tightly coupled [1].
       - **Modular RAG:** In contrast, Modular RAG decomposes the RAG system into independent modules and specialized operators. This creates a reconfigurable framework that is more like a LEGO set, allowing for easy modification, addition, or removal of components as needed [1].
    
    2. **Design Innovations:**
       - **Naive RAG:** Relies heavily on the similarity of document chunks for retrieval, which can lead to challenges like shallow query understanding and retrieval noise [1].
       - **Modular RAG:** Incorporates advanced design features such as routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms, supporting more complex RAG patterns like conditional, branching, and looping. This advanced design facilitates better handling of complex queries and variability in data [1].
    
    **Benefits at the Production Level:**
    
    1. **Flexibility and Scalability:**
       - Modular RAG's reconfigurable nature allows for rapid adaptation to changing requirements or integration of new technologies without overhauling the entire system. This is particularly advantageous in dynamic production environments where scalability and flexibility are paramount [1].
    
    2. **Maintenance and Upgrades:**
       - By having independent modules, updates or maintenance can be performed on specific parts of the system without affecting the overall functionality. This modular approach reduces downtime and simplifies the process of implementing new features or improvements [1].
    
    3. **Enhanced Performance:**
       - The ability to incorporate advanced mechanisms and patterns leads to more efficient and accurate retrieval and generation processes, resulting in improved performance of AI systems in production [1].
    
    These distinctions and benefits make Modular RAG a compelling choice for developers and organizations looking to deploy robust, adaptable, and high-performing AI systems in real-world applications.

    While the context provided does not include a specific real-world case study of Modular RAG deployment, it does highlight the general benefits that such a system would offer in practice. For example, in a production environment like customer service or a recommendation system, Modular RAG could significantly enhance performance by reducing computational overhead and improving processing speeds. This allows the system to handle large volumes of queries more efficiently, providing timely and accurate responses to users.
    
    The modular nature of the system also means that individual components can be optimized or replaced without disrupting the entire workflow, enabling continuous improvement and adaptation to changing requirements or data types [1][2]. This flexibility and efficiency make Modular RAG particularly suited for large-scale applications where scalability and adaptability are crucial.
    
    For a practical implementation, you might consider a company that deals with extensive customer interactions. By utilizing Modular RAG, it could systematically refine its retrieval and generation processes to ensure that customer queries are addressed with the most relevant and up-to-date information, thereby improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

    interview:
    Human: So you said you were writing an article on Explain how Modular RAG differs from traditional Naive RAG and the benefits of using it at the production level.?
    AI: Hello Dr. Mehta, my name is Alex Carter, and I'm an analyst delving into the practical applications of AI. I am particularly interested in understanding how Modular RAG differs from traditional Naive RAG and the benefits it brings when deployed at the production level. Could you explain these differences and benefits, perhaps with some specific examples?
    AI: Certainly, Dr. Mehta. Modular RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, represents an advancement over the traditional Naive RAG by addressing some of its inherent limitations, such as inflexibility and inefficiencies in handling diverse and dynamic datasets [3].
    
    **Differences:**
    
    1. **Flexibility and Efficiency:** Naive RAG systems are often limited in their ability to efficiently process diverse datasets due to a more rigid architecture. Modular RAG improves upon this by introducing a more flexible framework that can efficiently handle a wider variety of data inputs and adjust to dynamic data changes [3].
    
    2. **Embedding Techniques:** Advanced RAG models, including Modular RAG, often employ fine-tuned embeddings. These embeddings capture task-specific semantics or domain knowledge, which improves the quality of both the retrieved information and the generated responses. Modular RAG can adaptively adjust these embeddings during inference based on the context, leading to more relevant outputs [1].
    
    **Benefits at the Production Level:**
    
    1. **Reduced Computational Overhead:** By optimizing the retrieval and generation processes, Modular RAG can reduce computational overhead, making the system more efficient and cost-effective for large-scale deployment. This is particularly important in production environments where resource efficiency is crucial [1][2].
    
    2. **Improved Processing Speeds:** Modular RAG systems can achieve faster processing speeds due to their ability to handle data more efficiently and adapt to changes dynamically. This is advantageous in production settings where quick response times are essential [2].
    
    3. **Enhanced Accuracy and Context-Awareness:** By integrating retrieval into the generation process and using sophisticated embedding techniques, Modular RAG can provide more accurate and context-aware outputs. This makes it particularly effective for applications that require current or specialized knowledge, such as real-time customer support or complex data analysis [2].
    
    In summary, the transition from Naive to Modular RAG in production environments enhances flexibility, efficiency, and accuracy, thereby making AI systems more viable for large-scale deployment.

This allows the system to handle large volumes of queries more efficiently, providing timely and accurate responses to users.
    
    The modular nature of the system also means that individual components can be optimized or replaced without disrupting the entire workflow, enabling continuous improvement and adaptation to changing requirements or data types [1][2]. This flexibility and efficiency make Modular RAG particularly suited for large-scale applications where scalability and adaptability are crucial.
    
    For a practical implementation, you might consider a company that deals with extensive customer interactions. By utilizing Modular RAG, it could systematically refine its retrieval and generation processes to ensure that customer queries are addressed with the most relevant and up-to-date information, thereby improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

    These sub-modules allow for more granular control over the RAG process, enabling the system to fine-tune its operations based on the specific requirements of the task​. This pattern closely resembles the traditional RAG process but benefits from the modular approach by allowing individual modules to be optimized or replaced without altering the overall flow. For example, a linear RAG flow might begin with a query expansion module to refine the user’s input, followed by the retrieval module, which fetches the most relevant data chunks. The Modular RAG framework embraces this need through various tuning patterns that enhance the system’s ability to adapt to specific tasks and datasets. Managing these different data types and ensuring seamless integration within the RAG system can be difficult, requiring sophisticated data processing and retrieval strategies​(modular rag paper).

    Naive RAG established the groundwork for retrieval-augmented systems by combining document retrieval with language model generation. For example, in a question-answering task, RECALL ensures that a RAG system accurately incorporates all relevant points from retrieved documents into the generated answer. Vector databases play a crucial role in the operation of RAG systems, providing the infrastructure required for storing and retrieving high-dimensional embeddings of contextual information needed for LLMs. These embeddings capture the semantic and contextual meaning of unstructured data, enabling precise similarity searches that underpin the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation. By integrating retrieval into generation, RAG systems deliver more accurate and context-aware outputs, making them effective for applications requiring current or specialized knowledge.

    Naive RAG is a paradigm that combines information retrieval with natural language generation to produce responses to queries or prompts. In Naive RAG, retrieval is typically performed using retrieval models that rank the indexed data based on its relevance to the input query. These models generate text based on the input query and the retrieved context, aiming to produce coherent and contextually relevant responses. Advanced RAG models may fine-tune embeddings to capture task-specific semantics or domain knowledge, thereby improving the quality of retrieved information and generated responses. Dynamic embedding techniques enable RAG models to adaptively adjust embeddings during inference based on the context of the query or retrieved information.

    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities
    of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The
    increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG,
    leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary
    technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems.
    However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm,
    with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of
    "retrieve-then-generate". In this context, this paper examines the limitations
    of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By
    decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized
    operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG
    transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced

    ARGE Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
    remarkable capabilities, yet they still face numerous
    challenges, such as hallucination and the lag in information up-
    dates [1]. Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG), by access-
    ing external knowledge bases, provides LLMs with important
    contextual information, significantly enhancing their perfor-
    mance on knowledge-intensive tasks [2]. Currently, RAG, as
    an enhancement method, has been widely applied in various
    practical application scenarios, including knowledge question
    answering, recommendation systems, customer service, and
    personal assistants. [3]–[6]
    During the nascent stages of RAG , its core framework is
    constituted by indexing, retrieval, and generation, a paradigm
    referred to as Naive RAG [7]. However, as the complexity
    of tasks and the demands of applications have escalated, the

    limitations of Naive RAG have become increasingly apparent.
    As depicted in Figure 1, it predominantly hinges on the
    straightforward similarity of chunks, result in poor perfor-
    mance when confronted with complex queries and chunks with
    substantial variability. The primary challenges of Naive RAG
    include: 1) Shallow Understanding of Queries. The semantic
    similarity between a query and document chunk is not always
    highly consistent. Relying solely on similarity calculations
    for retrieval lacks an in-depth exploration of the relationship
    between the query and the document [8]. 2) Retrieval Re-
    dundancy and Noise. Feeding all retrieved chunks directly
    into LLMs is not always beneficial. Research indicates that
    an excess of redundant and noisy information may interfere
    with the LLM’s identification of key information, thereby
    increasing the risk of generating erroneous and hallucinated
    responses. [9]

    <Title>
    A Theory for Token-Level Harmonization in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance
    large language models (LLMs). Studies show that while RAG provides valuable
    external information (benefit), it may also mislead LLMs (detriment) with noisy
    or incorrect retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to
    preserve benefit and avoid detriment, they lack a theoretical explanation for
    RAG. The benefit and detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a
    black box that cannot be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so
    existing methods are data-driven, need additional utility evaluators or
    post-hoc. This paper takes the first step towards providing a theory to explain
    and trade off the benefit and detriment in RAG. First, we model RAG as the
    fusion between distribution of LLMs knowledge and distribution of retrieved
    texts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the value of external knowledge
    (benefit) and its potential risk of misleading LLMs (detriment) in next token
    prediction of RAG by distribution difference in this fusion. Finally, we prove
    that the actual effect of RAG on the token, which is the comparison between
    benefit and detriment, can be predicted without any training or accessing the
    utility of retrieval. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel method,
    Tok-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between the pure LLM and RAG
    at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments in
    real-world tasks using LLMs such as OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the
    effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical findings.

    ABSTRACT
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance large
    language models (LLMs). Studies show that while RAG provides valuable external
    information (benefit), it may also mislead LLMs (detriment) with noisy or incorrect
    retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to preserve benefit and
    avoid detriment, they lack a theoretical explanation for RAG. The benefit and
    detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a ’black box’ that cannot
    be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so existing methods are data-
    driven, need additional utility evaluators or post-hoc. This paper takes the first step
    towards providing a theory to explain and trade off the benefit and detriment in
    RAG. First, we model RAG as the fusion between distribution of LLM’s knowledge
    and distribution of retrieved texts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the
    value of external knowledge (benefit) and its potential risk of misleading LLMs
    (detriment) in next token prediction of RAG by distribution difference in this
    fusion. Finally, we prove that the actual effect of RAG on the token, which is the
    comparison between benefit and detriment, can be predicted without any training or
    accessing the utility of retrieval. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel
    method, Tok-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between the pure
    LLM and RAG at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments
    in real-world tasks using LLMs such as OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the
    effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical findings.

    INTRODUCTION
    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown promising performance in enhancing Large
    Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieved texts (Xu et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Asai et al.,
    2023; Ram et al., 2023). Studies indicate that while RAG provides LLMs with valuable additional
    knowledge (benefit), it also poses a risk of misleading them (detriment) due to noisy or incorrect
    retrieved texts (Ram et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024b;a; Jin et al., 2024a; Xie et al., 2023; Jin et al.,
    2024b). Existing methods attempt to preserve benefit and avoid detriment by adding utility evaluators
    for retrieval, prompt engineering, or fine-tuning LLMs (Asai et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2024; Xu et al.,
    2024b; Yoran et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023).
    However, existing methods are data-driven, need evaluator for utility of retrieved texts or post-hoc. A
    theory-based method, focusing on core principles of RAG is urgently needed, which is crucial for
    consistent and reliable improvements without relying on additional training or utility evaluators and
    improving our understanding for RAG.
    This paper takes the first step in providing a theoretical framework to explain and trade off the benefit
    and detriment at token level in RAG and proposes a novel method to preserve benefit and avoid
    detriment based on our theoretical findings. Specifically, this paper pioneers in modeling next token
    prediction in RAG as the fusion between the distribution of LLM’s knowledge and the distribution
    of retrieved texts as shown in Figure 1. Our theoretical derivation based on this formalizes the core
    of this fusion as the subtraction between two terms measured by the distribution difference: one is
    distribution completion and the other is distribution contradiction. Further analysis indicates that
    the distribution completion measures how much out-of-distribution knowledge that retrieved texts

    Retrieval-Augmented Test Generation: How Far Are We?
    </Title>
    
    <Summary>
    Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown notable advancements in
    software engineering tasks. Despite its potential, RAG's application in unit
    test generation remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we take the
    initiative to investigate the efficacy of RAG-based LLMs in test generation. As
    RAGs can leverage various knowledge sources to enhance their performance, we
    also explore the impact of different sources of RAGs' knowledge bases on unit
    test generation to provide insights into their practical benefits and
    limitations. Specifically, we examine RAG built upon three types of domain
    knowledge: 1) API documentation, 2) GitHub issues, and 3) StackOverflow Q&As.
    Each source offers essential knowledge for creating tests from different
    perspectives, i.e., API documentations provide official API usage guidelines,
    GitHub issues offer resolutions of issues related to the APIs from the library
    developers, and StackOverflow Q&As present community-driven solutions and best
    practices. For our experiment, we focus on five widely used and typical
    Python-based machine learning (ML) projects, i.e., TensorFlow, PyTorch,
    Scikit-learn, Google JAX, and XGBoost to build, train, and deploy complex
    neural networks efficiently. We conducted experiments using the top 10% most
    widely used APIs across these projects, involving a total of 188 APIs. We
    investigate the effectiveness of four state-of-the-art LLMs (open and
    closed-sourced), i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Mistral MoE 8x22B, and Llamma 3.1
    405B. Additionally, we compare three prompting strategies in generating unit
    test cases for the experimental APIs, i.e., zero-shot, a Basic RAG, and an
    API-level RAG on the three external sources. Finally, we compare the cost of
    different sources of knowledge used for the RAG.

    We conduct both qualitative and quantitative evaluations to investigate the generated test cases. For the
    quantitative analysis, we assess the syntactical and dynamic correctness of the generated tests. We observe
    that RAG does not improve the syntactical or dynamic correctness of unit test cases. However, using Basic
    RAG could improve the line coverage by an average of 8.94% and API-level RAG by 9.68%. We investigate
    the token cost of different RAGs with different prompting strategies. We find that RAGs using GitHub issue
    documents have the highest token cost. We also find that using limiting the number of test cases for cost
    efficiency significantly reduces the cost. Finally, we perform a manual analysis over a subset of the generated
    tests to evaluate how different strategies impact the software under test in more depth. We find that RAG helps
    cover unique lines by providing unique states of programs that cannot be generated directly by LLMs. Our
    study suggests that RAG has great potential in improving unit tests’ line coverage when the right documents
    with unique examples of program states are given. Proposing new retrieval techniques that can search these
    documents will further improve RAG-based unit test generation for future work.

    Certainly. One compelling example of Modular RAG's successful implementation is its use in enhancing knowledge-based question-answering (QA) systems with high-quality generative AI services. In this context, Modular RAG overcomes limitations found in traditional RAG models, such as the inability to incorporate real-time data and issues with contextual understanding. By utilizing graph technology, Modular RAG enables efficient information retrieval and synthesis, leading to more accurate and contextually aware responses [9].
    
    Specifically, a system using Modular RAG can employ a framework like LangGraph to assess the reliability of retrieved information and synthesize diverse data. This capability allows the system to adapt quickly to new information and queries, which is crucial in dynamic production environments. The modular framework's flexibility facilitates the integration of new modules and technologies without disrupting the existing setup, thereby enhancing scalability and efficiency [9].
    
    This adaptability and efficiency make Modular RAG particularly valuable for enterprise-level applications where the ability to handle a wide array of queries and datasets efficiently is a significant advantage.

    interview:
    Human: So you said you were writing an article on Explain how Modular RAG differs from traditional Naive RAG and the benefits of using it at the production level.?
    AI: Hello, my name is Alex Carter, and I am an AI research journalist. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me, Prof. Hinton. To start, could you explain how Modular RAG differs from traditional Naive RAG in the context of AI systems? What are the core distinctions that make Modular RAG more suitable for production environments?
    AI: Certainly, Prof. Hinton. Modular RAG differs from traditional Naive RAG in several key ways that enhance its effectiveness in production environments.
    
    1. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Naive RAG, while foundational, often struggles with inflexibility and inefficiencies when dealing with diverse and dynamic datasets. Modular RAG, on the other hand, improves upon this by allowing for more adaptable and flexible integration of retrieval and generation components. This modularity facilitates the customization of each component to better handle various data types and query contexts [3].
    
    2. **Dynamic Embedding Techniques**: Modular RAG employs dynamic embedding techniques that enable the system to adjust embeddings during inference based on the specific context of the query or the retrieved information. This results in more contextually relevant and coherent responses, which is a significant improvement over the static nature of embeddings in Naive RAG [1].
    
    3. **Integration with Vector Databases**: Another benefit of Modular RAG is the integration with vector databases, which provides the necessary infrastructure for storing and retrieving high-dimensional embeddings of contextual information. This integration allows for precise similarity searches, leading to more accurate and context-aware outputs. This capability is crucial for applications that require current or specialized knowledge [2].
    
    Overall, the modular nature of this approach allows for greater scalability and efficiency in AI models, making it particularly suited for production environments where adaptability and performance are essential.

       - Modular RAG allows for the easy integration of various knowledge bases, such as product manuals, FAQ databases, and recent customer interaction logs. This modular integration means that as new information becomes available, like updated product features or resolved issues, it can be seamlessly added to the system without disrupting current operations [1].
    
    2. **Adaptive Query Processing:**
       - With its ability to incorporate advanced routing and scheduling mechanisms, Modular RAG can dynamically adjust how queries are processed. For instance, simple queries can be routed through a basic retrieval module, while more complex queries might engage a series of specialized modules that can interact with multiple data sources to generate a comprehensive response [1].
    
    3. **Continuous Improvement and A/B Testing:**
       - The modular nature of Modular RAG systems allows for iterative improvements and experimentation. Different configurations or modules can be tested in parallel, such as trying out new retrieval strategies or integrating third-party APIs, to determine the most effective setup without overhauling the entire system [1].
    
    4. **Scalability and Customization:**
       - As the volume of customer interactions grows, the system can scale by adding more modules or enhancing existing ones. Additionally, customization for specific client needs or industry requirements can be achieved by swapping or upgrading individual modules without affecting the entire architecture [1].
    
    This kind of adaptability and maintainability not only enhances the performance and reliability of customer service systems but also allows businesses to provide timely and accurate assistance to their customers, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

    Human: So you said you were writing an article on Explain how Modular RAG differs from traditional Naive RAG and the benefits of using it at the production level.?
    AI: Hi Dr. Nguyen, my name is Jamie Carter, and I'm an analyst eager to delve into the world of AI systems architecture. I'm particularly interested in understanding the structural differences between Modular RAG and traditional Naive RAG, especially from the perspective of modularity and its benefits in a production environment. Could you start by explaining what sets Modular RAG apart from Naive RAG in terms of architecture?
    AI: Certainly, let's explore the differences between Modular RAG and traditional Naive RAG in terms of architecture and their implications for production environments.
    
    **Architectural Differences:**
    
    1. **Structure and Modularity:**
       - **Naive RAG:** This approach is characterized by a rigid and linear architecture, typically following a straightforward "retrieve-then-generate" process. This limits flexibility and adaptability, as each component of the system is tightly coupled [1].
       - **Modular RAG:** In contrast, Modular RAG decomposes the RAG system into independent modules and specialized operators. This creates a reconfigurable framework that is more like a LEGO set, allowing for easy modification, addition, or removal of components as needed [1].
    
    2. **Design Innovations:**
       - **Naive RAG:** Relies heavily on the similarity of document chunks for retrieval, which can lead to challenges like shallow query understanding and retrieval noise [1].
       - **Modular RAG:** Incorporates advanced design features such as routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms, supporting more complex RAG patterns like conditional, branching, and looping. This advanced design facilitates better handling of complex queries and variability in data [1].
    
    **Benefits at the Production Level:**
    
    1. **Flexibility and Scalability:**
       - Modular RAG's reconfigurable nature allows for rapid adaptation to changing requirements or integration of new technologies without overhauling the entire system. This is particularly advantageous in dynamic production environments where scalability and flexibility are paramount [1].
    
    2. **Maintenance and Upgrades:**
       - By having independent modules, updates or maintenance can be performed on specific parts of the system without affecting the overall functionality. This modular approach reduces downtime and simplifies the process of implementing new features or improvements [1].
    
    3. **Enhanced Performance:**
       - The ability to incorporate advanced mechanisms and patterns leads to more efficient and accurate retrieval and generation processes, resulting in improved performance of AI systems in production [1].
    
    These distinctions and benefits make Modular RAG a compelling choice for developers and organizations looking to deploy robust, adaptable, and high-performing AI systems in real-world applications.
