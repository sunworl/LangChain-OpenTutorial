## Overview
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to build a **Hierarchical Agent Team**.

We'll implement a hierarchical structure to break down complex tasks that are difficult to handle with a single agent or single-level supervisor. In this structure, each lower-level supervisor manages worker agents specialized in their respective domains.

This hierarchical approach helps efficiently solve complex tasks that would be overwhelming for a single worker or when there are too many workers to manage directly.

This example implements ideas from the [AutoGen paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155) using `LangGraph`, demonstrating how to organize two distinct teams for web research and document writing, managed through top and mid-level supervisors to oversee the entire process.

### Why Choose a **Hierarchical Agent Team**?

In our previous Supervisor example, we looked at how a single supervisor node assigns tasks to multiple worker nodes and consolidates their results. While this approach works well for simple cases, a hierarchical structure might be necessary in the following situations:

- **Increased Task Complexity**: A single supervisor may not be able to handle specialized knowledge required across various sub-domains simultaneously.
- **Growing Number of Workers**: When managing many workers, having a single supervisor directly command all workers can become overwhelming.

In such scenarios, we can create a hierarchical structure where higher-level supervisors delegate tasks to lower-level sub-supervisors, and each sub-supervisor then redistributes these tasks to their specialized worker teams.

## Environment Setup

Set up the environment. You may refer to [Environment Setup](https://wikidocs.net/257836) for more details.

**[Note]**
- `langchain-opentutorial` is a package that provides a set of easy-to-use environment setup, useful functions and utilities for tutorials.
- You can checkout the [`langchain-opentutorial`](https://github.com/LangChain-OpenTutorial/langchain-opentutorial-pypi) for more details.

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langchain-opentutorial
```

```python
# Install required packages
from langchain_opentutorial import package

package.install(
    [
        "langchain_community",
        "langchain_openai",
        "langchain_core",
        "langchain_experimental",
        "langgraph",
        "beautifulsoup4",
    ],
    verbose=False,
    upgrade=False,
)
```

`LangChain` provides built-in tools that make it easy to use the `Tavily` search engine as a tool in your applications.

To use `Tavily Search`, you'll need to obtain an API key.

Click [here](https://app.tavily.com/sign-in) to sign up on the `Tavily` website and get your `Tavily Search` API key.

```python
# Set environment variables
from langchain_opentutorial import set_env

set_env(
    {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "",
        "LANGCHAIN_API_KEY": "",
        "TAVILY_API_KEY": "",
        "LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2": "true",
        "LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT": "https://api.smith.langchain.com",
        "LANGCHAIN_PROJECT": "Hierarchical-Multi-Agent-Teams",
    }
)
```

<pre class="custom">Environment variables have been set successfully.
</pre>

You can alternatively set API keys in a `.env` file and load it.

[Note] This is not necessary if you've already set API keys in previous steps.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load API key information
load_dotenv(override=True)
```

## Building Tools

Each team consists of one or more agents, and each agent is equipped with one or more tools. Below, we'll define all the tools that will be used by various teams.
Let's first look at the research team.

### ResearchTeam Tools

The ResearchTeam can use search engines and URL scrapers to find information on the web. You can freely add additional features below to enhance the ResearchTeam's performance.

```python
import re
from typing import List
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.tools import tool

# Define search tool (TavilySearch)
# Create a search tool instance that returns up to 6 results
tavily_tool = TavilySearchResults(k=6)


# Define tool for scraping detailed information from web pages
@tool
def scrape_webpages(urls: List[str]) -> str:
    """Use requests and bs4 to scrape the provided web pages for detailed information."""
    # Load web pages using the provided URL list
    loader = WebBaseLoader(
        web_path=urls,
        header_template={
            "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/102.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
        },
    )
    docs = loader.load()
    
    def clean_text(html: str) -> str:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
        text = soup.get_text(separator=" ").strip()
        return re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)  # Remove excessive whitespace
    
    # Create a string containing titles and content of loaded documents
    return "\n\n".join(
        [
            f'<Document name="{doc.metadata.get("title", "").strip()}">\n{clean_text(doc.page_content)}\n</Document>'
            for doc in docs
        ]
    )
```

### Document Writing Team Tools

Next, we'll define the tools (file access tools) that the document writing team will use.
These tools allow agents to access the file system, which may not be secure. Therefore, caution is needed when using them.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, Optional, List
from typing_extensions import Annotated

# Create temporary directory and set working directory
WORKING_DIRECTORY = Path("./tmp")

# Create tmp folder if it doesn't exist
WORKING_DIRECTORY.mkdir(exist_ok=True)


# Create and save outline
@tool
def create_outline(
    points: Annotated[List[str], "List of main points or sections."],
    file_name: Annotated[str, "File path to save the outline."],
) -> Annotated[str, "Path of the saved outline file."]:
    """Create and save an outline."""
    with (WORKING_DIRECTORY / file_name).open("w") as file:
        for i, point in enumerate(points):
            file.write(f"{i + 1}. {point}\n")
    return f"Outline saved to {file_name}"


# Read document
@tool
def read_document(
    file_name: Annotated[str, "File path to read the document."],
    start: Annotated[Optional[int], "The start line. Default is 0"] = None,
    end: Annotated[Optional[int], "The end line. Default is None"] = None,
) -> str:
    """Read the specified document."""
    with (WORKING_DIRECTORY / file_name).open("r") as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    if start is not None:
        start = 0
    return "\n".join(lines[start:end])


# Write and save document
@tool
def write_document(
    content: Annotated[str, "Text content to be written into the document."],
    file_name: Annotated[str, "File path to save the document."],
) -> Annotated[str, "Path of the saved document file."]:
    """Create and save a text document."""
    with (WORKING_DIRECTORY / file_name).open("w") as file:
        file.write(content)
    return f"Document saved to {file_name}"


# Edit document
@tool
def edit_document(
    file_name: Annotated[str, "File path of the document to be edited."],
    inserts: Annotated[
        Dict[int, str],
        "Dictionary where key is the line number (1-indexed) and value is the text to be inserted at that line.",
    ],
) -> Annotated[str, "File path of the edited document."]:
    """Edit a document by inserting text at specific line numbers."""
    with (WORKING_DIRECTORY / file_name).open("r") as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Process insertions in order
    sorted_inserts = sorted(inserts.items())

    # Insert text at specified line numbers
    for line_number, text in sorted_inserts:
        if 1 <= line_number <= len(lines) + 1:
            lines.insert(line_number - 1, text + "\n")
        else:
            return f"Error: Line number {line_number} is out of range."

    # Save edited document to file
    with (WORKING_DIRECTORY / file_name).open("w") as file:
        file.writelines(lines)

    return f"Document edited and saved to {file_name}"
```

Finally, let's define the code execution tool, `PythonREPLTool`:

```python
from langchain_experimental.tools import PythonREPLTool

# PythonREPL tool
python_repl_tool = PythonREPLTool()
```

## Implementing Utility Functions for Multiple Agents
Here's how we create utility functions to streamline our tasks.

We'll use the `functools.partial` function from our previous tutorial to create agent nodes, specifically for:

1. Creating `worker agents`
2. Creating `supervisors` for `sub-graphs`

```python
from langgraph.graph import START, END
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAI


# Agent Factory Class
class AgentFactory:
    def __init__(self, model_name):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model_name, temperature=0)

    def create_agent_node(self, agent, name: str):
        # Node creation function
        def agent_node(state):
            result = agent.invoke(state)
            return {
                "messages": [
                    HumanMessage(content=result["messages"][-1].content, name=name)
                ]
            }

        return agent_node


# Initialize LLM
MODEL_NAME = "gpt-4o-mini"
llm = ChatOpenAI(model=MODEL_NAME, temperature=0)

# Create Agent Factory instance
agent_factory = AgentFactory(MODEL_NAME)
```

Here's an example of creating an agent node using the `AgentFactory`. Let's look at how to create a search agent:

```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

# Define agent
search_agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools=[tavily_tool])
# Create agent node
search_node = agent_factory.create_agent_node(search_agent, name="Searcher")
```

Next is the function for creating a Team Supervisor:

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Literal


def create_team_supervisor(model_name, system_prompt, members) -> str:
    # Define list of options for next worker
    options_for_next = ["FINISH"] + members

    # Define response model for worker selection
    class RouteResponse(BaseModel):
        next: Literal[*options_for_next]

    # Create ChatPromptTemplate
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
        [
            ("system", system_prompt),
            MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="messages"),
            (
                "system",
                "Given the conversation above, who should act next? "
                "Or should we FINISH? Select one of: {options}",
            ),
        ]
    ).partial(options=str(options_for_next))

    # Initialize LLM
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model_name, temperature=0)

    # Combine prompt and LLM to create chain
    supervisor_chain = prompt | llm.with_structured_output(RouteResponse)

    return supervisor_chain
```

## Defining Agent Teams
Let's define the Research Team and Doc Writing Team.

### Research Team

The research team has two worker nodes: a `search agent` and a `research_agent` responsible for `web scraping`. Let's create these and set up their team supervisor:

```python
import operator
from typing import List, TypedDict
from typing_extensions import Annotated

from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage, HumanMessage
from langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent


# Define state
class ResearchState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], operator.add]  # Messages
    team_members: List[str]  # List of member agents
    next: str  # Instructions for Supervisor agent to select next worker


# Initialize LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model=MODEL_NAME, temperature=0)

# Create search node
search_agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools=[tavily_tool])
search_node = agent_factory.create_agent_node(search_agent, name="Searcher")

# Create web scraping node
web_scraping_agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools=[scrape_webpages])
web_scraping_node = agent_factory.create_agent_node(
    web_scraping_agent, name="WebScraper"
)

# Create Supervisor agent
supervisor_agent = create_team_supervisor(
    MODEL_NAME,
    "You are a supervisor tasked with managing a conversation between the"
    " following workers: Search, WebScraper. Given the following user request,"
    " respond with the worker to act next. Each worker will perform a"
    " task and respond with their results and status. When finished,"
    " respond with FINISH.",
    ["Searcher", "WebScraper"],
)
```

Finally, let's define a function to select the next node for routing:

```python
def get_next_node(x):
    return x["next"]
```

### Creating Research Team Graph

Creates a workflow where a supervisor coordinates web search and scraping tasks.

```python
from langchain_opentutorial.graphs import visualize_graph
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
```

```python
# Create graph
web_research_graph = StateGraph(ResearchState)

# Add nodes
web_research_graph.add_node("Searcher", search_node)
web_research_graph.add_node("WebScraper", web_scraping_node)
web_research_graph.add_node("Supervisor", supervisor_agent)

# Add edges
web_research_graph.add_edge("Searcher", "Supervisor")
web_research_graph.add_edge("WebScraper", "Supervisor")

# Define conditional edges: move to next node based on Supervisor's decision
web_research_graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "Supervisor",
    get_next_node,
    {"Searcher": "Searcher", "WebScraper": "WebScraper", "FINISH": END},
)

# Set entry point
web_research_graph.set_entry_point("Supervisor")

# Compile graph
web_research_app = web_research_graph.compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver())

# Visualize graph
visualize_graph(web_research_app, xray=True)
```


    
![png](./img/output_27_0.png)
    


Let's run the `web_research_app`:

```python
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langchain_opentutorial.messages import random_uuid, invoke_graph


def run_graph(app, message: str, recursive_limit: int = 50):
    # Set configuration
    config = RunnableConfig(
        recursion_limit=recursive_limit, configurable={"thread_id": random_uuid()}
    )

    # Prepare input
    inputs = {
        "messages": [HumanMessage(content=message)],
    }

    # Execute graph and display output
    invoke_graph(app, inputs, config)

    return app.get_state(config).values
```

```python
output = run_graph(
    web_research_app,
    "Please summarize the main news from https://finance.yahoo.com/ and include the sources (URLs).",
)
```

### Document Writing Team
Now let's create the document writing team. Here, we'll grant different file-writing tool access to each agent.

```python
import operator
from typing import List, TypedDict, Annotated
from pathlib import Path

# Create temporary directory and set working directory
WORKING_DIRECTORY = Path("./tmp")
WORKING_DIRECTORY.mkdir(exist_ok=True)  # Create tmp folder if it doesn't exist


# Define state
class DocWritingState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], operator.add]
    team_members: str
    next: str
    current_files: str  # Currently working files


# State preprocessing node: Helps each agent better recognize current working directory state
def preprocess(state):
    # Initialize list of written files
    written_files = []

    try:
        # Search all files in working directory and convert to relative paths
        written_files = [
            f.relative_to(WORKING_DIRECTORY) for f in WORKING_DIRECTORY.rglob("*")
        ]
    except Exception:
        pass

    # Add "No files written." to state if no files exist
    if not written_files:
        return {**state, "current_files": "No files written."}

    # Add list of written files to state
    return {
        **state,
        "current_files": "\nBelow are files your team has written to the directory:\n"
        + "\n".join([f" - {f}" for f in written_files]),
    }


# Initialize LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model=MODEL_NAME)

# Create document writing agent
doc_writer_agent = create_react_agent(
    llm,

    ["DocWriter", "NoteTaker", "ChartGenerator"],
)
```

### Creating Doc Writing Team Graph

Integrates document writing, note-taking, and chart generation into a unified flow.

```python
# Create graph
authoring_graph = StateGraph(DocWritingState)

# Define nodes
authoring_graph.add_node("DocWriter", doc_writing_node)
authoring_graph.add_node("NoteTaker", note_taking_node)
authoring_graph.add_node("ChartGenerator", chart_generating_node)
authoring_graph.add_node("Supervisor", doc_writing_supervisor)

# Define edges
authoring_graph.add_edge("DocWriter", "Supervisor")
authoring_graph.add_edge("NoteTaker", "Supervisor")
authoring_graph.add_edge("ChartGenerator", "Supervisor")

# Define conditional edges: Move to next node based on Supervisor node's decision
authoring_graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "Supervisor",
    get_next_node,
    {
        "DocWriter": "DocWriter",
        "NoteTaker": "NoteTaker",
        "ChartGenerator": "ChartGenerator",
        "FINISH": END,
    },
)

# Set entry point
authoring_graph.set_entry_point("Supervisor")

# Compile graph
authoring_app = authoring_graph.compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver())
```

    6. Conclusion  
    
    ## 1. Introduction  
    The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of machine learning, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). Introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., the Transformer model is unique in its reliance on self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrent or convolutional layers. This allows for better parallelization during training and greater capability to handle long-range dependencies in data. The architecture has paved the way for state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT, and T5. This paper aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the architecture, its components, and its various applications.
    
    ## 2. Background  
    Before the advent of the Transformer model, traditional neural networks utilized recurrent architectures to process sequential data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were the go-to choices for tasks involving sequences due to their ability to maintain hidden states across time steps. However, these methods faced challenges such as long training times and difficulties in handling long-range dependencies. With the introduction of self-attention mechanisms in the Transformer, these challenges became less pronounced, leading to significant improvements in performance and efficiency. Understanding the limitations of previous architectures sets the stage for appreciating the innovations brought forth by the Transformer.
    
    ## 3. Transformer's Architecture  
    The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where both components are built from identical layers. Each encoder layer contains two main sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feed-forward network. The decoder, similarly, has these two sub-layers but includes an additional multi-head attention over the encoder output, allowing it to attend to the input sequence while generating the output. Importantly, residual connections and layer normalization are used around each sub-layer to facilitate training stability and speed up convergence. The unique architecture enables highly efficient parallelization, a crucial factor in its rapid adoption in large-scale applications.
    
    ### 3.1. Multi-Head Attention  
    The multi-head attention mechanism is one of the core innovations of the Transformer architecture. It allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. By projecting the input into multiple heads independently, the model can learn a range of attention patterns and selectively focus on relevant parts of the input. Each head computes attention scores using queries, keys, and values, and the results are concatenated and linearly transformed into the output. This mechanism enhances the model’s ability to capture relationships and dependencies, significantly improving performance on various tasks.
    
    ### 3.2. Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks  
    Position-wise feed-forward networks (FFNs) are essential components of the Transformer model that enhance its representational capacity. Each position in the sequence is processed independently through a feed-forward neural network where the same weights are applied across all positions. Usually, this involves a two-layer network with a ReLU activation function, allowing the model to capture intricate patterns in the input data. The use of FFNs contributes to the overall expressiveness of the model, facilitating complex transformations of the input representations at each layer. This enables the Transformer to learn high-level abstractions in the data, improving its performance on tasks such as translation and summarization.
    
    ### 3.3. Positional Encoding  
    Positional encoding is a critical aspect of the Transformer architecture, compensating for the lack of inherent sequential order in the input data. Since the self-attention mechanism treats all input tokens equally, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide information about token positions. This encoding can be learned or, more commonly, computed using sinusoidal functions. The sinusoidal approach allows the model to leverage the periodic nature of the encoding, enabling effective learning of relative positions among tokens. By integrating positional encodings, the Transformer retains the capacity to understand order and sequence, crucial for tasks involving sequential data.
    
    ## 4. Training the Transformer  
    Training the Transformer architecture presents unique challenges and considerations. Unlike traditional architectures, the Transformer employs parallelization, allowing for faster training times. Success during training often relies on efficient loss functions that guide the learning process, with the commonly used cross-entropy loss being particularly effective for NLP tasks. Additionally, optimization techniques like learning rate schedules and transformers-specific optimizers such as Adam have been designed to improve convergence and handling of variances across multiple heads. Moreover, techniques such as dropout and early stopping help prevent overfitting and improve generalization during training.
    
    ### 4.1. Loss Functions  
    The choice of loss function is paramount to the success of training the Transformer architecture. Cross-entropy loss is the standard choice for tasks involving classification and sequence generation, as it measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. In the context of NLP, this often entails measuring how well the model predicts the next word in a sentence given the previous context. Recently, alternatives such as label smoothing have also been introduced to enhance model performance by mitigating overconfidence in predictions. The selection and implementation of loss functions directly influence model performance, shaping how it learns from data throughout training.
    
    ### 4.2. Optimization Techniques  
    Optimization techniques used in training the Transformer architecture are pivotal to achieving high performance efficiently. Adam, a popular gradient-based optimization algorithm, has shown impressive results due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities. Additionally, techniques like learning rate warmup have become commonplace to stabilize training rates in the early stages. Regularization methods such as dropout and layer normalization further assist in managing overfitting and promote better convergence properties. The correct deployment of these optimization strategies is essential to harness the full potential of the Transformer model, especially when training on large datasets.
    
    ## 5. Applications of Transformer Architecture  
    The Transformer architecture's flexibility and power have led to its deployment across a wide array of applications. In natural language processing, models like BERT and GPT leverage its capabilities for tasks such as sentiment analysis, text generation, and translation. Beyond NLP, the architecture's ability to capture important features has been successfully applied in computer vision, where models like Vision Transformers (ViTs) utilize the architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Further, the architecture's advantages have extended into speech recognition, enhancing models designed to translate spoken language into written text. The breadth of applications underscores the transformative impact of the Transformer architecture across various fields.
    
    ### 5.1. Natural Language Processing  
    Natural language processing (NLP) has experienced a paradigm shift with the introduction of the Transformer architecture. Tasks such as machine translation, summarization, and sentiment classification have benefitted significantly from the self-attention mechanism and the model’s ability to process long-range dependencies. Models like BERT have redefined state-of-the-art performance benchmarks, tackling various NLP tasks efficiently by leveraging unsupervised learning on vast text corpora. Additionally, the flexibility of the Transformer architecture allows seamless adaptation to various NLP tasks, making it the foundation for many subsequent models and techniques. The advancements achieved in NLP as a result of the Transformer architecture continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in understanding and generating human language.
    
    ### 5.2. Computer Vision  
    The Transformer architecture has also made significant inroads into the field of computer vision. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) dominated image classification tasks, but Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as formidable competitors. By treating image patches as sequences, ViTs apply the Transformer’s self-attention mechanism to capture spatial relationships and patterns across the entire image. This approach has led to state-of-the-art results on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize well from limited labeled data. As research in vision transformers continues to evolve, further innovations and enhancements promise to reshape the landscape of image analysis and understanding.
    
    ### 5.3. Speech Recognition  
    Speech recognition technologies have similarly benefited from the application of Transformer architectures. The ability of Transformers to effectively process sequential data has rendered them invaluable in translating spoken language into written text. Hybrid models that combine traditional temporal convolutional networks with Transformer components have shown marked improvements in accuracy. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism allows these models to focus on relevant segments of audio input, crucial for decoding nuanced speech patterns. As attention-based mechanisms gain traction in this domain, the performance of speech recognition systems is expected to improve dramatically, expanding their applicability.
    
    ## 6. Conclusion  
    In conclusion, the Transformer architecture represents a groundbreaking leap in deep learning paradigms, providing a robust and efficient framework for handling various tasks across multiple domains. Its self-attention mechanism, combined with components conducive to parallelization, allows for significant performance improvements over previous architectures. As research continues to explore the potential of Transformers, new architectures and enhancements build upon the principles established by the original model. The wide array of applications, ranging from natural language processing to computer vision and speech recognition, underscores its versatility and significance in the contemporary machine learning landscape. The future of deep learning remains bright, with the Transformer architecture at the forefront of innovation and development.

## Structuring a Super-Graph

This design implements a bottom-up planning policy. Although we've already created two graphs, we need to determine how to route tasks between them.

For this purpose, we'll define a **Super-Graph** to coordinate these two existing graphs and add connecting elements that define how this higher-level state is shared between different graphs. First, let's create the chief supervisor node:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Create ChatOpenAI instance as the base LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model=MODEL_NAME)

# Create team supervisor node
supervisor_node = create_team_supervisor(
    MODEL_NAME,
    "You are a supervisor tasked with managing a conversation between the"
    " following teams: ['ResearchTeam', 'PaperWritingTeam']. Given the following user request,"
    " respond with the worker to act next. Each worker will perform a"
    " task and respond with their results and status. When finished,"
    " respond with FINISH.",
    ["ResearchTeam", "PaperWritingTeam"],
)
```

Next, we'll define the state and nodes of the Super-Graph.

The Super-Graph primarily serves to route tasks between teams.

```python
from typing import TypedDict, List, Annotated
import operator


# Define state
class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], operator.add]
    # Routing decision
    next: str


# Node for returning the last message
def get_last_message(state: State) -> str:
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    if isinstance(last_message, str):
        return {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=last_message)]}
    else:
        return {"messages": [last_message.content]}


# Node for consolidating responses
def join_graph(response: dict):
    # Extract the last message and return as a message list
    return {"messages": [response["messages"][-1]]}
```

### Defining the Super-Graph

Now, let's define a Super-Graph that connects the two teams.

```python
# Define graph
super_graph = StateGraph(State)

# Define nodes
super_graph.add_node("ResearchTeam", get_last_message | web_research_app | join_graph)
super_graph.add_node("PaperWritingTeam", get_last_message | authoring_app | join_graph)
super_graph.add_node("Supervisor", supervisor_node)

# Define edges
super_graph.add_edge("ResearchTeam", "Supervisor")
super_graph.add_edge("PaperWritingTeam", "Supervisor")

# Add conditional edges: Move to next node based on Supervisor's decision
super_graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "Supervisor",
    get_next_node,
    {
        "PaperWritingTeam": "PaperWritingTeam",
        "ResearchTeam": "ResearchTeam",
        "FINISH": END,
    },
)

# Set Supervisor node as the entry point
super_graph.set_entry_point("Supervisor")

# Compile graph
super_graph = super_graph.compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver())
```

Let's visualize the graph:

```python
# Visualize graph
visualize_graph(super_graph, xray=True)
```


    
![png](./img/output_47_0.png)
    


```python
output = run_graph(
    super_graph,

Magentic-One represents a significant step towards developing agents that can complete tasks that people encounter in their work and personal lives. We are also releasing an open-source implementation of Magentic-One (opens in new tab) on Microsoft AutoGen, our popular open-source framework for developing multi-agent applications. The future of AI is agentic. AI systems are evolving from having conversations to getting things done—this is where we expect much of AI’s value to shine. It’s the difference between generative AI recommending dinner options to agentic assistants that can autonomously place your order and arrange delivery. It’s the shift from summarizing research papers to actively searching for and organizing relevant studies in a comprehensive literature review. Modern AI agents, capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting on our behalf, are demonstrating remarkable performance in areas such as software engineering, data analysis, scientific research, and web navigation. Still, to fully realize the long-held vision of agentic systems that can enhance our productivity and transform our lives, we need advances in generalist agentic systems. These systems must reliably complete complex, multi-step tasks across a wide range of scenarios people encounter in their daily lives. Introducing Magentic-One (opens in new tab), a high-performing generalist agentic system designed to solve such tasks. Magentic-One employs a multi-agent architecture where a lead agent, the Orchestrator, directs four other agents to solve tasks. The Orchestrator plans, tracks progress, and re-plans to recover from errors, while directing specialized agents to perform tasks like operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing Python code. Magentic-One achieves statistically competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on multiple challenging agentic benchmarks, without requiring modifications to its core capabilities or architecture. Built on AutoGen (opens in new tab), our popular open-source multi-agent framework, Magentic-One’s modular, multi-agent design offers numerous advantages over monolithic single-agent systems. By encapsulating distinct skills in separate agents, it simplifies development and reuse, similar to object-oriented programming. Magentic-One’s plug-and-play design further supports easy adaptation and extensibility by enabling agents to be added or removed without needing to rework the entire system—unlike single-agent systems, which often struggle with inflexible workflows. We’re making Magentic-One open-source (opens in new tab) for researchers and developers. While Magentic-One shows strong generalist capabilities, it’s still far from human-level performance and can make mistakes. Moreover, as agentic systems grow more powerful, their risks—like taking undesirable actions or enabling malicious use-cases—can also increase. While we’re still in the early days of modern agentic AI, we’re inviting the community to help tackle these open challenges and ensure our future agentic systems are both helpful and safe. To this end, we’re also releasing AutoGenBench (opens in new tab), an agentic evaluation tool with built-in controls for repetition and isolation to rigorously test agentic benchmarks and tasks while minimizing undesirable side-effects. Code on GitHub Read the technical report How it works Magentic-One features an Orchestrator agent that implements two loops: an outer loop and an inner loop. The outer loop (lighter background with solid arrows) manages the task ledger (containing facts, guesses, and plan) and the inner loop (darker background with dotted arrows) manages the progress ledger (containing current progress, task assignment to agents). Magentic-One work is based on a multi-agent architecture where a lead Orchestrator agent is responsible for high-level planning, directing other agents and tracking task progress. The Orchestrator begins by creating a plan to tackle the task, gathering needed facts and educated guesses in a Task Ledger that is maintained. At each step of its plan, the Orchestrator creates a Progress Ledger where it self-reflects on task progress and checks whether the task is completed. If the task is not yet completed, it assigns one of Magentic-One other agents a subtask to complete. After the assigned agent completes its subtask, the Orchestrator updates the Progress Ledger and continues in this way until the task is complete. If the Orchestrator finds that progress is not being made for enough steps, it can update the Task Ledger and create a new plan. This is illustrated in the figure above; the Orchestrator work is thus divided into an outer loop where it updates the Task Ledger and an inner loop to update the Progress Ledger. Magentic-One consists of the following agents: Orchestrator: The lead agent responsible for task decomposition, planning, directing other agents in executing subtasks, tracking overall progress, and taking corrective actions as needed WebSurfer: An LLM-based agent proficient in commanding and managing the state of a Chromium-based web browser. For each request, the WebSurfer performs actions such as navigation (e.g., visiting URLs, performing searches), interacting with webpages (e.g., clicking, typing), and reading actions (e.g., summarizing, answering questions). It then reports on the new state of the webpage. The WebSurfer relies on the browser’s accessibility tree and set-of-marks prompting to perform its tasks. FileSurfer: An LLM-based agent that commands a markdown-based file preview application to read local files. It can also perform common navigation tasks such as listing directory contents and navigating through them. Coder: An LLM-based agent specialized in writing code, analyzing information collected from the other agents, and creating new artifacts. ComputerTerminal: Provides access to a console shell for executing programs and installing new libraries. Together, Magentic-One’s agents equip the Orchestrator with the tools and capabilities it needs to solve a wide range of open-ended problems and autonomously adapt to, and act in, dynamic and ever-changing web and file-system environments. While the default multimodal LLM used for all agents is GPT-4o, Magentic-One is model-agnostic, allowing the integration of heterogeneous models to support different capabilities or meet different cost requirements. For example, different LLMs and SLMs or specialized versions can power different agents. For the Orchestrator, we recommend a strong reasoning model, like GPT-4o. In a different configuration, we also experimented with using OpenAI o1-preview for the Orchestrator’s outer loop and for the Coder, while other agents continued to use GPT-4o. Evaluation To rigorously evaluate Magentic-One’s performance, we introduce AutoGenBench, an open-source standalone tool for running agentic benchmarks that allows repetition and isolation, e.g., to control for variance of stochastic LLM calls and side-effects of agents taking actions in the world. AutoGenBench facilitates agentic evaluation and allows adding new benchmarks. Using AutoGenBench, we can evaluate Magentic-One on a variety of benchmarks. Our criterion for selecting benchmarks is that they should involve complex multi-step tasks, with at least some steps requiring planning and tool use, including using web browsers to act on real or simulated webpages. We consider three benchmarks in this work that satisfy this criterion: GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena. In the Figure below we show the performance of Magentic-One on the three benchmarks and compare with GPT-4 operating on its own and the per-benchmark highest-performing open-source baseline and non open-source benchmark specific baseline according to the public leaderboards as of October 21, 2024. Magentic-One (GPT-4o, o1) achieves statistically comparable performance to previous SOTA methods on both GAIA and AssistantBench and competitive performance on WebArena. Note that GAIA and AssistantBench have a hidden test set while WebArena does not, and thus WebArena results are self-reported. Together, these results establish Magentic-One as a strong generalist agentic system for completing complex tasks. Evaluation results of Magentic-One on the GAIA, AssistantBench and WebArena. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Note that WebArena results are self-reported. Risks and mitigations Agentic systems like Magentic-One mark a significant shift in both the opportunities and risks associated with AI. Magentic-One interacts with a digital world designed for humans, taking actions that can change states and potentially lead to irreversible consequences. These inherent and undeniable risks were evident during our testing, where several emerging issues surfaced. For example, during development, a misconfiguration led agents to repeatedly attempt and fail to log into a WebArena website. This resulted in the account being temporarily suspended. The agents then tried to reset the account’s password. Even more concerning were cases in which agents, until explicitly stopped, attempted to recruit human assistance by posting on social media, emailing textbook authors, or even drafting a freedom of information request to a government entity. In each case, the agents were unsuccessful due to a lack of the required tools or accounts, or because human observers intervened. Aligned with the Microsoft AI principles and Responsible AI practices, we worked to identify, measure, and mitigate potential risks before deploying Magentic-One. Specifically, we conducted red-teaming exercises to assess risks related to harmful content, jailbreaks, and prompt injection attacks, finding no increased risk from our design. Additionally, we provide cautionary notices and guidance for using Magentic-One safely, including examples and appropriate default settings. Users are advised to keep humans in the loop for monitoring, and ensure that all code execution examples, evaluations, and benchmarking tools are run in sandboxed Docker containers to minimize risks. Recommendations and looking forward We recommend using Magentic-One with models that have strong alignment, pre- and post-generation filtering, and closely monitored logs during and after execution. In our own use, we follow the principles of least privilege and maximum oversight. Minimizing risks associated with agentic AI will require new ideas and extensive research, as much work is still needed to understand these emerging risks and develop effective mitigations. We are committed to sharing our learnings with the community and evolving Magentic-One in line with the latest safety research. As we look ahead, there are valuable opportunities to improve agentic AI, particularly in safety and Responsible AI research. Agents acting on the public web may be vulnerable to phishing, social engineering, and misinformation threats, much like human users. To counter these risks, an important direction is to equip agents with the ability to assess the reversibility of their actions—distinguishing between those that are easily reversible, those that require effort, and those that are irreversible. Actions like deleting files, sending emails, or filing forms are often difficult or impossible to undo. Systems should therefore be designed to pause and seek human input before proceeding with such high-risk actions. We invite the community to collaborate with us in ensuring that future agentic systems are both helpful and safe. For further information, results and discussion, please see our technical report.

    Building a Multi-Agent System to Accomplish Complex Tasks | by Najib Sharifi, Ph.D. | Towards AIOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inBuilding a Multi-Agent System to Accomplish Complex TasksA simple framework for multi-agent systems allowing specialized agents to communicate and collaborate for multi-step tasks.Najib Sharifi, Ph.D.·FollowPublished inTowards AI·8 min read·May 24, 2024--ListenShareWhen ChatGPT first arrived, it was game-changing. Now, it is used by people in all sectors and lines of work. ChatGPT demonstrated the strength of these machine learning models that most of us thought was not possible anytime soon. Whilst these LLMs have become increasingly more powerful in their capabilities, however, a very exciting development with immense potential is the use of multi-agents systems. For example, Devine AI, the first autonomous AI software engineer, is based multi-agent framework.A Climate AnalystIf you ask chatgpt to write you an article about any topic, there are several problems which result in chatgpt not producing a good report such as no access to up-to-date data about the topic, which can lead to hallucinations. What if we break down this complex to individual tasks? Consider a climate change analyst writing a report on the latest environmental trends; he/she would need to do a number of tasks (I appreciate this may be a simplification of the role but this is just for a demonstration purpose):· Research to find out all the key data from reliable sources.· Analyse all the resultant data and extract key interpretations of the data.· Write a report explaining the findings.· The report would then get peer-reviewed to ensure the scientific report is accurate and the findings are supported by the data presented.What if we have specialized agents for each task? i.e. one agent is the researcher, and another agent behaves as the analyst to analyze the data found, another agent is the writer, and a 4th agent is the critic who will ensure that the article findings are supported by the data presented (but hopefully unlikely real scientists, it won’t ask you to reference their completely irrelevant work in your article). These systems leverage the strengths of individual agents, each with specialized roles and capabilities, to collaboratively achieve complex tasks. This article delves into the potential of LLM agents to drive the next wave of developments, demonstrating their capabilities through a practical example of building a multiagent system.Building a Multiagent System: Climate Change AnalystYou can build multiagent systems using frameworks like CrewAI, the work demonstrated in this article is nothing but a humble attempt at building a very simple framework for the multiagent system. How these agents communicate, remember (they have memory, short and long!) and are coordinated are crucial to their performance. The aim of this article is to set up a simple framework, by doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of these systems rather than importing everything from a readymade library and treating it as a Blackbox. We are going to build a system that can write an article on the latest trends in climate change, as mentioned above. We will develop a team of specialized agents that can research, analyze, write a scientific report, and peer review that report.Image generated with copilate.Lets Dive in! Setting up the environment and importing key libraries. We need to provide the agent doing the research a tool. This tool will allow the agent to google search through an API, I will use the crewai library SerperDevTool to do this.import osimport openaifrom openai import OpenAIfrom crewai_tools import SerperDevToolos.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "your serper api key goes here"os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your open AI key goes here"client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))search_tool = SerperDevTool(api_key=os.getenv("SERPER_API_KEY"))Defining the agent class, each agent will have a specialised role, goal and backstory which we will assign later. The agent is able to store the task queried as well as the corresponding output, enabling short term memory. It can also message all other agents, as well as read messages sent from other agents.class Agent: def __init__(self, name, role, backstory, goal, tools=None): self.name = name self.backstory = backstory self.goal = goal self.role = role self.memory = [] self.tools = tools if tools else [] self.message_box = [] # adding memory for the agent to store recent tasks and outputs def add_to_memory(self, entry): self.memory.append(entry) # sending messages to other agents def send_message(self, recipient, message): recipient.message_box.append((self.name, message)) # reading the messages sent from other agents before performing task # this is done by removing messages from message box and added to memory def read_messages(self): while self.message_box: sender, message = self.message_box.pop(0) self.add_to_memory(f"message from the {sender}: {message}") # we now define the function that will do the task assigned # reading messages and adding task to the memory first # the agent will take up the specialised role assigned and querry gpt3.5 def do_task(self, task, inputs): self.read_messages() task_info = task.info self.add_to_memory(f"doing task: {task_info}") '''for the research agent, the search_tool will be assigned to the agent which it will be able to use to do a google search online''' if 'search_tool' in self.tools: search_query = task_info search_results = search_tool.run(query=search_query) inputs['search_results'] = search_results task_info += f"\n\nsearch results:\n{search_results}" llm_response = client.chat.completions.create( model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[ {"role": "system", "content": f"you are a {self.role}. {self.backstory} Your goal is {self.goal}."}, {"role": "user", "content": task_info} ] ) output = llm_response.choices[0].message.content self.add_to_memory(f"task output: {output}") return outputThe Architect, whose purpose is to (besides creating the matrix of course) assign the tasks to the corresponding agents and coordinate the flow of information between the agents. In this framework, besides the messaging between agents, the work is in a sequential form i.e. work from each agent is passed to the next one, there is no delegation or iteration of the tasks for the agents. However, in crewai framework, I think it has these properties which make it very powerful in its capabilities.class TheArchitect: def __init__(self, agents, tasks): # dictionary of all agents based on name self.agents = {agent.name: agent for agent in agents} self.tasks = tasks def process(self, inputs): results = {} current_result = None for task in self.tasks: task_agent = self.agents[task.agent.name] '''to help with debugging and also checking flow of info we can check/print which tasks are assigned to which agent''' print(f"assignin task {task.name} to agent {task_agent.name}: {task.info}") if current_result: inputs['previous_result'] = current_result if 'search' in inputs: search_query = inputs['search'] search_results = search_tool.run(query=search_query) inputs['search_results'] = search_results agent_output = task_agent.do_task(task, inputs) current_result = agent_output # send the agent's output as a message to all other agents for agent_name, agent in self.agents.items(): if agent_name != task_agent.name: task_agent.send_message(agent, agent_output) results[task.agent.name] = agent_output return resultsNow that we have defined the agents class and the architect class, lets create instances of these classes to define different agents with different roles.We can now define all the agents and give them names, roles, goals, backstories and tools. These agents only data collectors, data scientists, and report writers. In this case, we only have the researcher/data collector with a tool.data_collector = Agent( name="researcher", role="Climate Data Collector", goal="Collect comprehensive climate data from multiple sources.", backstory="You gather climate data on temperature, carbon dioxide levels and other variables relevant to climate change, from reliable sources.", tools=['search_tool'])data_analyst = Agent( name="Data Scientist", role="Climate Data Scientist", goal="Analyse the collected climate data to identify significant trends.", backstory="You analyse climate data to find significant trends and understand the impact of various factors on climate change.", tools=[])report_writer = Agent( name="Report Writer", role="Senior Scientific Report Writer", goal="Generate a comprehensive report on climate change findings.", backstory="You write detailed scientific reports based on the analysed climate data, highlighting key findings and implications.", tools=[])peer_reviewer = Agent( name="Peer Reviewer", role="Scientific Peer Reviewer", goal="Review the scientific report for accuracy, clarity, and completeness.", backstory="You review scientific reports to ensure they are accurate, clear, and meet the standards for scientific publication.", tools=[])final_report_writer = Agent( name="Final Report Writer", role="Final Report Writer", goal="Incorporate peer review feedback and finalize the scientific report.", backstory="You finalize the scientific report by incorporating feedback from peer reviewer and ensure it is publication ready.", tools=[])We need to split any problem into a series of tasks and assign an agent to each one. The information and expected_output is critical to getting the agent to behave and output what you desire from the agent.analyse_data = Task( info=( "Using the following climate data, analyze for trends and patterns:\n{previous_result}\n" "1. Identify significant trends in temperature, CO2 levels, and precipitation.\n" "2. Determine potential causes of observed trends.\n" "3. Summarize key findings in a detailed analysis report." ), expected_output="Detailed analysis report on climate data trends and potential causes.", agent=data_analyst, name="Data Analysis")write_report = Task( info=( "Using the following analysis report, write a comprehensive scientific report on climate change findings:\n{previous_result}\n" "1. Include an introduction, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion.\n" "2. Use clear and precise language suitable for a scientific audience.\n" "3. Ensure all findings are supported by data and analysis." ), expected_output="Comprehensive scientific report on climate change findings.", agent=report_writer, name="Report Writing")review_report = Task( info=( "Using the following scientific report, review for accuracy, clarity, and completeness:\n{previous_result}\n" "1. Ensure the report adheres to scientific standards.\n" "2. Check for any errors or inaccuracies in data and analysis.\n" "3. Provide feedback and suggestions for improvement." ), expected_output="Reviewed and revised scientific report, ready for publication.", agent=peer_reviewer, name="Peer Review")finalize_report = Task( info=( "Using the following peer-reviewed report, incorporate feedback and finalize the scientific report:\n{previous_result}\n" "1. Address all feedback and suggestions provided by the peer reviewer.\n" "2. Ensure the report is polished and ready for publication.\n" "3. Provide the final version of the scientific report." ), expected_output="Finalized scientific report, ready for publication.", agent=final_report_writer, name="Finalize Report")Let’s bring it all together now. We can now create a system of agents and tasks and run it.ClimateResearchSystem = TheArchitect( agents=[data_collector, data_analyst, report_writer, peer_reviewer, final_report_writer], tasks=[collect_data, analyse_data, write_report, review_report, finalize_report])result = ClimateResearchSystem.process(inputs={ "topic": "Climate Change", "search": "latest climate data trends"})The final report, lets visualise the output of the multiagent system using markdown. The key question is, is this report any better than using chatgpt (no agents) to write a scientific report on climate trends?from IPython.display import MarkdownMarkdown(result['Final Report Writer'])This article could be significantly improved if you provide it with better tools; for example, providing some mathematical tools for data analysis could allow the agent to perform numerical analysis and present findings. These systems will only be as good as the tools you provide it with, which in this case, we have not provided any, besides a tool to search the internet. That brings yes to the end of the article; thank you for taking the time to read it, I hope you found it insightful! If you are interested, definitely explore these multiagent systems for a range of different problems, it’s not just about writing reports but with the right tools defined, these agents can be very powerful. This topic is still under heavy development, it is very exciting to see how it will develop.Unless otherwise noted, all images are by the author----FollowPublished in Towards AI73K Followers·Last published 3 hours agoThe leading AI community and content platform focused on making AI accessible to all.

    Architectures for AI Agents: From Basic to Multi-Agent Systems All Posts Subscribe In AI — Jun 26, 2024 Architectures for AI Agents By: Stephen Pimentel 6 min read From simple to complexAI agents are systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing tasks autonomously. Unlike more static AI models, agents interact dynamically with their environment, adapting to new information and leveraging tools to accomplish complex objectives. Let's take a look at AI agent architectures and examine key considerations for their effective use. We'll start with basic agents and then move on to multi-agent systems (MAS).Basic agentsAgents utilize a model, such as a Large Language Model (LLM), to manage and execute tasks. These systems leverage the extensive language comprehension and generation capabilities of current models. By integrating planning, reasoning, and tool execution within a single framework, agents are designed to handle a wide array of tasks autonomously. These agents typically operate in a structured manner, continuously refining their approach until they achieve the desired outcome.Basic agents excel in environments where tasks are well-defined and require minimal feedback from external sources. Their streamlined architecture makes them easier to implement and manage. This simplicity translates to higher efficiency and consistency in executing straightforward function calls. For instance, tasks such as personal news aggregation, where the system compiles and summarizes news articles based on predefined criteria, are well-suited to basic agents. The agent can independently gather data, evaluate its relevance, and refine its output, ensuring a high level of precision and control.At their most sophisticated, basic agents can integrate planning, acting, and reasoning using algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This method uses heuristic-based search to explore various options, and a state evaluator to choose the best action:While such architectures can produce excellent results on simpler benchmarks, they are resource-intensive and may not perform as well on more complex tasks.Despite their strengths, basic agents face significant challenges. One limitation is their propensity to get stuck in execution loops, especially when tasked with complex, multifaceted problems. Without the ability to receive feedback from other agents, a basic agent may repetitively generate the same actions, failing to progress towards the goal. Additionally, these systems may struggle with tasks requiring robust reasoning and refinement capabilities, as they lack the collaborative input that MAS provide. This limitation can lead to suboptimal outcomes, particularly in dynamic environments where adaptability and diverse perspectives are crucial.For example, in scenarios like complex event planning, where multiple aspects such as venue selection, catering, and scheduling need to be managed simultaneously, a basic agent might falter. The absence of collaborative problem-solving can result in inefficiencies and errors, pointing to the need for MAS in such contexts.Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)MAS involve multiple agents, each potentially equipped with different language models and tools, working collaboratively to solve complex tasks. These systems simulate the dynamic interactions found in human teams, where each agent can contribute uniquely based on its specialized capabilities. For example, some agents might focus on data retrieval, while others handle analysis and report generation.One of the primary strengths of MAS is their ability to handle complex tasks that require collaboration and parallel processing. This is particularly effective for problems that involve multiple distinct execution paths, where different agents can work concurrently to expedite the process. For instance, in a complex research task, one agent might gather relevant literature while another synthesizes the information, and yet another drafts a summary, all working simultaneously.Additionally, MAS can leverage diverse expertise. By integrating agents with different specializations, the system can provide more comprehensive solutions than a basic agent. This diversity fosters robust problem-solving capabilities, enabling the system to adapt and respond to varied and unexpected challenges.There are many MAS architectures, but they tend to employ two primary design principles: leader-follower and peer-to-peer. With leader-follower designs, a lead agent coordinates the activities of follower agents. This hierarchical approach ensures a clear division of labor, with each agent reporting back to the leader. While this can streamline decision-making and task allocation, it also risks creating information bottlenecks if the lead agent fails to effectively disseminate critical information.With peer-to-peer designs, all agents operate on an equal footing, sharing information and decisions via message-passing. This egalitarian approach encourages collaboration and feedback. However, it can also lead to inefficiencies if agents engage in irrelevant communication, making it important to implement filtering and prioritization mechanisms.Let's look at a few architectures making use of these principles.MAS architecturesStructured teamsAgents can be structured to work in teams, with a particular focus on organized communication and leadership. The architecture typically includes modules for configuration, perception, memory, and execution, enabling agents to translate environmental observations into actions effectively.The designated leader coordinates the actions of other agents, significantly improving task efficiency and reducing communication overhead. The leadership structure helps mitigate issues related to redundant messaging and disordered decision-making, common pitfalls in multi-agent cooperation. Structured teams can further improve their efficiency by continuously evaluating and optimizing their structure and communication patterns.Dynamic teamsMAS can be structured in dynamic teams for handling complex reasoning and code generation tasks. The architecture assigns roles to agents based on their contributions and performance, ensuring that only the most effective agents are engaged in subsequent rounds of task execution. This peer-to-peer structure, devoid of a central leader, fosters an environment where agents can share information freely and adapt their strategies in real-time.Dynamic teams allow for high flexibility and responsiveness, crucial for tasks that require continual adjustment and optimization.Phased executionAn MAS architecture can segment task execution into distinct phases, such as recruitment, decision-making, agent execution, and evaluation. This phased approach is versatile, accommodating both leader-follower and peer-to-peer structures depending on the task requirements.In the recruitment phase, agents are selected or removed based on their relevance to the task at hand. During decision-making, agents discuss and plan their approach, leveraging diverse perspectives to refine their strategy. This phase is followed by agent execution, where each agent independently performs its designated role. Finally, the evaluation phase involves assessing the outcomes and adjusting the team composition and strategies as needed.This phased approach attempts to get the right agents engaged at the right times, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the team.Publish-subscribe communicationTo avoid unproductive chatter in MAS, a design can enforce structured outputs and utilize a publish-subscribe mechanism for information sharing. Instead of engaging in free-form conversation, agents produce structured messages, which are then shared in a controlled manner. This approach significantly reduces unnecessary communication and ensures that all agents have access to relevant information.The publish-subscribe mechanism further streamlines communication by allowing agents to subscribe only to the information pertinent to their tasks. This reduces cognitive load and improves focus, leading to more efficient task execution. Publish-subscribe communication can work particularly well in scenarios requiring extensive coordination and knowledge synthesis.Approaches to reasoningEffective AI agents must possess robust reasoning abilities to interact with complex environments, make informed decisions, and adapt to new information dynamically. Reasoning is fundamental to cognition, enabling agents to simulate human-like decision-making processes, thereby improving their problem-solving capabilities. There are several approaches to reasoning.Task decomposition involves breaking down a complex task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. By tackling each sub-task individually, agents can simplify problem solving, making it easier to achieve the overall objective. Task decomposition is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks are inherently hierarchical or sequential.Multiple plan selection involves generating multiple potential plans for a given task and then selecting the optimal one based on predefined criteria. Multiple plan selection allows agents to explore various strategies and choose the best path forward, enhancing flexibility and adaptability.Memory-augmented planning leverages memory to retain context and historical information. This enables agents to make informed decisions based on past experiences and adapt their strategies accordingly. By storing and retrieving relevant information, agents can improve their performance in tasks that require sustained attention and contextual understanding.Agents frequently need to interact with external tools to solve complex problems, which often requires multiple iterations of reasoning, recall, and reflection. Tool-calling enhances the agent’s capabilities by providing access to specialized functions that extend beyond the built-in capabilities of a model.The advantage of parallelismMAS excel at managing parallel tasks, allowing different agents to work on separate subproblems simultaneously. This not only speeds up problem solving but ensures that tasks are handled by the agents best suited to their specific requirements. By dividing a larger problem into smaller, independent subproblems, MAS can also improve their robustness. Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of the task, and their collective efforts lead to a more comprehensive solution. This division of labor minimizes the risk of failure and enhances the system’s overall efficiency.For example, in a scenario where a system is tasked with compiling a detailed market analysis report, one agent could be responsible for gathering raw data, another for analyzing trends, and a third for drafting the report. By working in parallel, these agents can produce a more thorough and timely analysis than a basic agent.The range of MASWhile basic agents are well-suited for straightforward tasks with clearly defined tools, they often fall short in more complex and dynamic environments. MAS, on the other hand, have a broader range of capabilities, particularly excelling in collaborative and parallel task execution. The designs of MAS allow them to divide labor intelligently and adapt to feedback from both users and the environment. Effective feedback mechanisms make MAS more versatile and useful in complex problem-solving scenarios.
