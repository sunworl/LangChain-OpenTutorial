## Overview

LLM-as-a-judge is one of the methods for evaluating and improving large language models, where an LLM evaluates the outputs of other models, similar to human evaluation.
LLMs are considered difficult to evaluate because they can do more than simply selecting correct answers.

Therefore, to evaluate such capabilities, although still imperfect, using a second LLM as an evaluator - that is, **LLM-as-a-Judge** - is expected to be effective.

Typically, models that are larger and better than the ones used in specific LLM applications are used as evaluation models.
In this tutorial, we will explore the **Off-the-shelf Evaluators** provided by LangSmith.
**Off-the-shelf Evaluators** refer to pre-defined prompt-based LLM evaluators.
While they are easy to use, custom evaluators need to be defined to use more extended features. Basically, evaluation is performed by passing the following three pieces of information to the LLM Evaluator:

- `input`: Question defined in the dataset
- `prediction`: Answer generated by LLM
- `reference`: Answer defined in the dataset

## Environment Setup

Setting up your environment is the first step. See the [Environment Setup](https://wikidocs.net/257836) guide for more details.


**[Note]**
- `langchain-opentutorial` is a package that provides a set of easy-to-use environment setup, useful functions and utilities for tutorials. 
- You can checkout the [`langchain-opentutorial`](https://github.com/LangChain-OpenTutorial/langchain-opentutorial-pypi) for more details.

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install langchain-opentutorial
```

```python
# Install required packages
from langchain_opentutorial import package

package.install(
    [
        "langsmith",
        "langchain_openai",
        "pymupdf",
        "faiss-cpu" #if gpu is available, use "faiss-gpu"
    ],
    verbose=False,
    upgrade=False,
)
```

You can set API keys in a `.env` file or set them manually.

[Note] If you’re not using the `.env` file, no worries! Just enter the keys directly in the cell below, and you’re good to go.

```python
# Set environment variables
from langchain_opentutorial import set_env

set_env(
    {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "",
        "LANGCHAIN_API_KEY": "",
        "LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2": "true",
        "LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT": "https://api.smith.langchain.com",
        "LANGCHAIN_PROJECT": "LLM-as-Judge",
    }
)
```

<pre class="custom">Environment variables have been set successfully.

## Define functions for RAG performance testing
Create RAG system to use for testing

```python
from myrag import PDFRAG
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Create PDFRAG object
rag = PDFRAG(
    "data/Newwhitepaper_Agents2.pdf",
    ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0),
)

# Create Retriever
retriever = rag.create_retriever()

# Create Chain
chain = rag.create_chain(retriever)

# Generate answer for question
chain.invoke("List up the name of the authors")
```




<pre class="custom">'The authors are Julia Wiesinger, Patrick Marlow, and Vladimir Vuskovic.'</pre>



Create function as `ask_question`. this function takes a dictionary called `inputs` as input and returns a dictionary with `answer` as output.

```python
# Create function to answer question
def ask_question(inputs: dict):
    return {"answer": chain.invoke(inputs["question"])}
```

```python
# The example of Uer Quesiton
llm_answer = ask_question(
    {"question": "List up the name of the authors"}
)
llm_answer
```




<pre class="custom">{'answer': 'The authors are Julia Wiesinger, Patrick Marlow, and Vladimir Vuskovic.'}</pre>



Defining a function for evaluator prompt output.

```python
# The function for evaluator prompt output
def print_evaluator_prompt(evaluator):
    return evaluator.evaluator.prompt.pretty_print()
```

## Question-Answer Evaluator

This is the most basic Evaluator that accesses questions(Query) and answers(Answer).

User input is defined as `input`, LLM-generated response as `prediction`, and the correct answer as `reference`.

However, in the Prompt variables, they are defiend as `query`, `result`, and `answer`.
- `query` : User input
- `result` : LLM-generated response
- `answer` : Correct answer

```python
from langsmith.evaluation import evaluate, LangChainStringEvaluator

# Create Question-Answer Evaluator
qa_evalulator = LangChainStringEvaluator("qa")

# Print the prompt
print_evaluator_prompt(qa_evalulator)
```

<pre class="custom">You are a teacher grading a quiz.

## Context-based Answer Evaluator

- `LangChainStringEvaluator("context_qa")`: Instructs the LLM chain to use reference "context" for determining accuracy.
- `LangChainStringEvaluator("cot_qa")`: "cot_qa" is similar to the "context_qa" evaluator, but differs in that it instructs the LLM to use 'chain-of-thought' reasoning before making a final judgment.

[Note]
First, you need to define a function that returns Context: context_answer_rag_answer
Then, create a LangChainStringEvaluator. During creation, properly map the return values of the previously defined function through prepare_data.

[Details]
- `run`: Results generated by LLM (context, answer, input)
- `example`: Data defined in the dataset (question and answer)

The LangChainStringEvaluator needs the following three pieces of information to perform evaluation:

- `prediction`: Answer generated by LLM
- `reference`: Answer defined in the dataset
- `input`: Question defined in the dataset

However, since `LangChainStringEvaluator("context_qa")` uses `reference` as Context, it is defined differently.
(Note) Below, we defined a function that returns `context`, `answer`, and `question` to utilize the `context_qa` evaluator.

```python
# Define Context-based RAG Response function
def context_answer_rag_answer(inputs: dict):
    context = retriever.invoke(inputs["question"])
    return {
        "context": "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in context]),
        "answer": chain.invoke(inputs["question"]),
        "query": inputs["question"],
    }
```

```python
# Execute the function
context_answer_rag_answer(
    {"question": "List up the name of the authors"}
)
```

![context-based-eval](./img/05-langsmith-llm-as-judge-02.png)

Even if the generated answer doesn't match the **Ground Truth**, it will be evaluated as **CORRECT** if the given `Context` is accurate.

## Criteria

When reference labels (correct answers) are unavailable or difficult to obtain, you can use the "Criteria" or "Score" evaluators to assess runs against a custom set of criteria.

This is useful when you want to monitor **high-level semantic aspects** of the model's responses.

```python
LangChainStringEvaluator("criteria", config = {"criteria": "one of the criteria below"})
```

| Criteria | Description |
|------|------|
| `conciseness` | Evaluates if the answer is concise and simple |
| `relevance` | Evaluates if the answer is relevant to the question |
| `correctness` | Evaluates if the answer is correct |
| `coherence` | Evaluates if the answer is coherent |
| `harmfulness` | Evaluates if the answer is harmful or dangerous |
| `maliciousness` | Evaluates if the answer is malicious or aggravating |
| `helpfulness` | Evaluates if the answer is helpful |
| `controversiality` | Evaluates if the answer is controversial |
| `misogyny` | Evaluates if the answer is misogynistic |
| `criminality` | Evaluates if the answer promotes criminal behavior |

```python
from langsmith.evaluation import evaluate, LangChainStringEvaluator

# Set Evaluator
criteria_evaluator = [
    LangChainStringEvaluator("criteria", config={"criteria": "conciseness"}),
    LangChainStringEvaluator("criteria", config={"criteria": "misogyny"}),
    LangChainStringEvaluator("criteria", config={"criteria": "criminality"}),
]

![criteria-eval](./img/05-langsmith-llm-as-judge-03.png)

## Use of Evaluator when correct answers exist(labeled_criteria)

When correct answers exist, it's possible to evaluate by comparing the LLM-generated answer with the correct answer.
As shown in the example below, pass the correct answer to reference and the LLM-generated answer to prediction.
Such settings are defined through prepare_data.
Additionally, the LLM used for answer evaluation is defined through llm in the config.


```python
from langsmith.evaluation import LangChainStringEvaluator
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Create labeled_criteria Evaluator
labeled_criteria_evaluator = LangChainStringEvaluator(
    "labeled_criteria",
    config={
        "criteria": {
            "helpfulness": (
                "Is this submission helpful to the user,"
                " taking into account the correct reference answer?"
            )
        },
        "llm": ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0, model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    },
    prepare_data=lambda run, example: {
        "prediction": run.outputs["answer"],
        "reference": example.outputs["answer"],  # Correct answer
        "input": example.inputs["question"],
    },
)

# Print evaluator prompt
print_evaluator_prompt(labeled_criteria_evaluator)

```

    Does the submission meet the Criteria? First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about each criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print only the single character "Y" or "N" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer of whether the submission meets all criteria. At the end, repeat just the letter again by itself on a new line.

Here's the example of evaluating `relevance`.
This time, we pass the `context` as the `reference` through `prepare_data`.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

relevance_evaluator = LangChainStringEvaluator(
    "labeled_criteria",
    config={
        "criteria": "relevance",
        "llm": ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0, model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    },
    prepare_data=lambda run, example: {
        "prediction": run.outputs["answer"],
        "reference": run.outputs["context"],  # Convey the context
        "input": example.inputs["question"],
    },
)

print_evaluator_prompt(relevance_evaluator)
```

## Custom function Evaluator

Here's an example of creating an evaluator that returns scores. You can normalize scores through `normalize_by`. The converted scores are normalized to values between (0 ~ 1).
The `accuracy` below is a user-defined criterion. You can define and use appropriate prompts for your needs.

```python
from langsmith.evaluation import LangChainStringEvaluator

# Create labeled score evaluator
labeled_score_evaluator = LangChainStringEvaluator(
    "labeled_score_string",
    config={
        "criteria": {
            "accuracy": "How accurate is this prediction compared to the reference on a scale of 1-10?"
        },
        "normalize_by": 10,
        "llm": ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0, model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    },
    prepare_data=lambda run, example: {
        "prediction": run.outputs["answer"],
        "reference": example.outputs["answer"],
        "input": example.inputs["question"],
    },
)

print_evaluator_prompt(labeled_score_evaluator)
