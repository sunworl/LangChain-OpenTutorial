### UpstageDocumentParseLoader in LangChain
The UpstageDocumentParseLoader is a component of the langchain_upstage package that integrates Upstage's Document Parser API into the LangChain framework. It enables seamless loading and parsing of documents within LangChain applications. 


```python
# Install the langchain-upstage package using pip:
# pip install -U langchain-upstage
```

```python
from langchain_upstage import UpstageDocumentParseLoader

loader = UpstageDocumentParseLoader(
            file_path, split="page", 
            output_format="markdown",
            base64_encoding=["figure", "chart", "table"]
         )
docs = loader.load_and_split()
```

```python
len(docs)
```




<pre class="custom">25</pre>



Inspect parsed documents to check for and display base64-encoded content along with a brief summary of each document's content and metadata.


```python
for i, j in enumerate(docs[:5]):
    bs_encoding = j.metadata['base64_encodings']

    if len(bs_encoding) > 0:
        print(f"ð **Page {i+1}**\n{'='*20}")
        print(f"ð **Page Content Preview:** {j.page_content[:100]}...")
        print(f"ð **Metadata Keys:** {', '.join(j.metadata.keys())}")
        print(f"ð¼ï¸ **Base64 Encoding (Preview):** {bs_encoding[0][:10]}...")
        print("\n")
```

from langchain_core.documents import Document
import base64

    new_documents = []
    
    for doc in docs:
        # Check if base64_encodings exist in metadata
        if 'base64_encodings' in doc.metadata and len(doc.metadata['base64_encodings']) > 0:

    **Out of 73 economies assessed, only**
    **fiveâCanada, Mainland China,**
    **Singapore, the UK, and the USâ**
    **are categorized as AI pioneers.**
    They have reached a high level of
    readiness by blending elements like
    investment and infrastructure, turning
    disruption into a competitive edge.
    They are in a unique position to guide
    the world forward in innovation,
    talent development, and AI regulation
    and ethics.
    
    
    **Several economies with high**
    **AI readiness are just behind the**
    **pace of AI pioneers. While this**
    group of AI contenders includes
    established economies, it also
    features emerging ones like India,
    Saudi Arabia, and the UAE that are
    using policy and targeted investments
    to adopt AI on an advanced level. As
    these economies strengthen their
    innovation capabilities, they will grow
    more competitive and influential in
    the AI space.
    
    
    **Most economies in the study are**
    **not ready for AI disruption. More**
    **than 70% score below the halfway**
    **mark in categories like ecosystem**
    **participation, skills, and R&D.**
    Policymakers must act now to adjust
    to a world of AI and boost resiliency,
    productivity, jobs, modernization, and
    competitiveness.

## Building a RAG Pipeline with LangGraph

This guide demonstrates how to use LangGraph to build a unified RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application. By combining retrieval and generation into a single flow, LangGraph offers streamlined execution, deployment, and additional features like persistence and human-in-the-loop approval.

### Key Components

1. **Application State**:
   - Tracks input (`question`), intermediate (`context`), and output (`answer`) data using a `TypedDict`.

2. **Application Steps**:
   - **Retrieve**: Uses `Chroma` for similarity-based document retrieval.
   - **Generate**: Formats retrieved context and question, then invokes `ChatOpenAI` to generate an answer.

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Uses `StateGraph` to define the sequence and connections between steps.

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(merged_documents)
```

```python
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")
vector_store = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=all_splits,
    embedding=embeddings
    )
```

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from typing_extensions import List, TypedDict

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
# Define prompt for question-answering
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate([
    ("human", """
You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. 
Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. 
Question: {question} 
Context: {context} 
Answer:
""")])


# Define state for application
class State(TypedDict):
    question: str
    context: List[Document]
    answer: str


# Define application steps
def retrieve(state: State):
    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(state["question"])
    return {"context": retrieved_docs}


def generate(state: State):
    docs_content = "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in state["context"])
    messages = prompt.invoke({"question": state["question"], "context": docs_content})
    response = llm.invoke(messages)
    return {"answer": response.content}


# Compile application and test
graph_builder = StateGraph(State).add_sequence([retrieve, generate])
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "retrieve")
graph = graph_builder.compile()
```

```python
response = graph.invoke({"question": "Please list AI pioneers"})
print(response["answer"])
```

<pre class="custom">The AI pioneers, as mentioned in the context, are Canada, Mainland China, Singapore, the UK, and the US.
</pre>

As shown in the image below, the answer was correctly predicted.

```python
import base64
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(data="assets/AI_Pioneers.png"))  # Display the image
