        "\n",
        "LLM is a powerful technology, but it has limitations in reflecting real-time information due to the constraints of its training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's say NASA discovered a new planet yesterday, making the total number of planets in the solar system nine. What would happen if we asked an LLM about the number of planets in the solar system? Because LLM responds based on its trained data, it would say there are eight planets. We call this phenomenon **hallucination** , and to resolve this, we need to wait for a model **version up** .\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG emerged to overcome these limitations. Instead of immediately responding to user questions, the RAG pipeline first searches for the latest information from external knowledge repositories and then generates responses based on this information. This enables the system to provide answers that reflect the most **up-to-date** information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Is Our RAG Design Effective?\n",
        "\n",
        "You have learned various techniques for implementing RAG. Some of you may have already built your own RAG systems and applied them to your work.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we need to ask an important question: Is our RAG system truly a 'good' RAG? How can we judge the quality of RAG?\n",
        "\n",
        "Simply saying \"this RAG doesn't perform well\" is not enough. We need to be able to measure and verify RAG's performance through objective evaluation metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Use Synthetic Test Dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluating the performance of RAG systems is a crucial process. However, manually creating hundreds of question-answer pairs requires enormous time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, manually written questions often remain at a simple and superficial level, making it difficult to thoroughly evaluate the performance of RAG systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "By utilizing synthetic data to solve these problems, we can reduce developer time spent on building test datasets by up to 90%. Additionally, it enables more thorough performance evaluation by automatically generating test cases of various difficulty levels and types."

However, they often rely on tools\\n- like books, Google Search, or a calculator - to supplement their prior knowledge before\\narriving at a conclusion. Just like humans, Generative AI models can be trained to use tools\\nto access real-time information or suggest a real-world action. For example, a model can\\nleverage a database retrieval tool to access specific information, like a customer's purchase\\nhistory, so it can generate tailored shopping recommendations. Alternatively, based on a\\nuser's query, a model can make various API calls to send an email response to a colleague\\nor complete a financial transaction on your behalf. To do so, the model must not only have\\naccess to a set of external tools, it needs the ability to plan and execute any task in a self-\\ndirected fashion. This combination of reasoning, logic, and access to external information\\nthat are all connected to a Generative AI model invokes the concept of an agent, or a\\nprogram that extends beyond the standalone capabilities of a Generative AI model.

Agents are autonomous and can act independently of human intervention,\\nespecially when provided with proper goals or objectives they are meant to achieve. Agents\\ncan also be proactive in their approach to reaching their goals. Even in the absence of\\nexplicit instruction sets from a human, an agent can reason about what it should do next to\\nachieve its ultimate goal. While the notion of agents in AI is quite general and powerful, this\\nwhitepaper focuses on the specific types of agents that Generative AI models are capable of\\nbuilding at the time of publication.\\nIn order to understand the inner workings of an agent, let’s first introduce the foundational\\ncomponents that drive the agent’s behavior, actions, and decision making. The combination\\nof these components can be described as a cognitive architecture, and there are many\\nsuch architectures that can be achieved by the mixing and matching of these components.\\nFocusing on the core functionalities, there are three essential components in an agent’s\\ncognitive architecture as shown in Figure 1.\\nSeptember 2024 5\\n'),\n",

Some key takeaways from this whitepaper include:\\n1. Agents extend the capabilities of language models by leveraging tools to access real-\\ntime information, suggest real-world actions, and plan and execute complex tasks\\nautonomously. agents can leverage one or more language models to decide when and\\nhow to transition through states and use external tools to complete any number of\\ncomplex tasks that would be difficult or impossible for the model to complete on its own.\\n2. At the heart of an agent’s operation is the orchestration layer, a cognitive architecture that\\nstructures reasoning, planning, decision-making and guides its actions. Various reasoning\\ntechniques such as ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, and Tree-of-Thoughts, provide a framework\\nfor the orchestration layer to take in information, perform internal reasoning, and generate\\ninformed decisions or responses.\\n3. Tools, such as Extensions, Functions, and Data Stores, serve as the keys to the outside\\nworld for agents, allowing them to interact with external systems and access knowledge\\nbeyond their training data. Extensions provide a bridge between agents and external APIs,\\nenabling the execution of API calls and retrieval of real-time information. functions provide\\na more nuanced control for the developer through the division of labor, allowing agents\\nto generate Function parameters which can be executed client-side. Data Stores provide\\nagents with access to structured or unstructured data, enabling data-driven applications.\\nThe future of agents holds exciting advancements and we’ve only begun to scratch the\\nsurface of what is possible. As tools become more sophisticated and reasoning capabilities\\nare enhanced, agents will be empowered to solve increasingly complex problems.\\nFurthermore, the strategic approach of ‘agent chaining’ will continue to gain momentum.
