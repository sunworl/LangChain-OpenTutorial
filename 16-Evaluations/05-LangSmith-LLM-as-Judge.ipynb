        "LLM-as-a-judge is one of the methods for evaluating and improving large language models, where an LLM evaluates the outputs of other models, similar to human evaluation.\n",
        "LLMs are considered difficult to evaluate because they can do more than simply selecting correct answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, to evaluate such capabilities, although still imperfect, using a second LLM as an evaluator - that is, **LLM-as-a-Judge** - is expected to be effective.\n",

        "Typically, models that are larger and better than the ones used in specific LLM applications are used as evaluation models.\n",

        "**Off-the-shelf Evaluators** refer to pre-defined prompt-based LLM evaluators.\n",
